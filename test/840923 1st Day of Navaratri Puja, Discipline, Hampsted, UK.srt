1
00:00:04,229 --> 00:00:24,060
Today is a great day for all of us, can you hear me there? That we are celebrating Navaratri today

2
00:00:24,069 --> 00:00:32,290
 and all of us are meeting after such a long time of My tour.

3
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:55,390
When in Italy I said that England is the  heart of the universe, they would not accept it. They were very shocked at this statement.

4
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:04,500
They couldn't believe that England could be the heart of the universe. One of the reasons

5
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:29,210
was that they felt that  the English people were invaded once by Romans, and Romans at that time also had felt that

6
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:36,020
English were very bumptious people. They would not even accept the defeat with the grace

7
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:44,330
of a person who is lost. Even if they were lost, they used to be bumptious. So they could

8
00:01:44,339 --> 00:01:50,290
not believe how could it be that the English is the heart of the universe. If this is the heart,

9
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:57,090
what's the situation of the universe? And then they described to Me at length the

10
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:06,490
bumptiousness of the English, and then I felt I have known something like that Myself.

11
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:15,670
Now, when we are celebrating the greatest of greatest this Navaratri, there must be

12
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:31,040
something special about it, that we have to cleanse this heart completely, fully and make

13
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:41,480
it so pure that it purifies all the blood that passes through the whole of the body.

14
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:52,090
So the cells of this heart, which has made this great organ, has to be the best, because

15
00:02:52,099 --> 00:03:07,550
the cells of the heart within a human body are the best cells, the highest quality,

16
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:26,170
 the most sensitive. And it's the heart that expresses the Anahata, the sound that is without percussion.

17
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:41,290
While we find that there are some people of caliber, there are, but others talk more,

18
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:54,940
show off more, and do not have the caliber. Now to achieve that caliber should be possible

19
00:03:54,949 --> 00:04:03,800
because you are born on the special land of England. That possibility must be built within you.

20
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:17,070
But then what is lacking? Why is it, that with all the possibility, with all the great background,

21
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:31,410
with all the merits to be here, why is it we find that Sahaja Yogis, for years

22
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:36,680
together, do not come up to many others. What is the reason?

23
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:50,180
Heart, if you see, has a pulse rate and it moves with a certain sound, and you can even

24
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:58,930
get it on to a graph and it is so systematic, it is so regularized, it is so disciplined,

25
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:09,220
that even a slightest murmur, or slightest change shows on the graph. Is a very sensitive thing.

26
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:19,650
And that is what is lacking here, is that discipline of the heart. It's an erratic,

27
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:30,520
funny heart which swell's up in ego. And whatever one may talk, this is another reading people have,

28
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:36,180
that whatever you may tell them, that time seriously they listen to you and second

29
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:44,930
moment it has no effect on them. So this is another thing we should see that if it is

30
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:53,650
within us, let us understand that what we lack is disciplining. And that disciplining

31
00:05:53,659 --> 00:06:05,630
has to come, otherwise our caliber cannot improve. But for all that, I think what we

32
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:14,340
should have is innate intelligence. No education, innate intelligence. Innate intelligence to

33
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:23,150
understand that our caliber has to improve.

34
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:44,000
Now here pulsates the Spirit, the Spirit and not the Power. The witness, the one that watches,

35
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:55,180
that is the reflection of God, who is the Spectator of the Work of the Devi. Actually

36
00:06:55,189 --> 00:07:04,780
what happens that without rising up to that status if we also say, "All right, we are

37
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:17,500
also watching because we are the Spirit," then we do not achieve that caliber. And with

38
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:30,500
all the blessings, like seven auras of the heart, we have got seven ashrams. We do not

39
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:41,050
understand that we all have to discipline ourselves. Only to take advantage or to be

40
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:54,660
in the Sahaja Yoga, to claim that you are a Sahaja Yogi, is not a sign of being a cell of the heart.

41
00:07:54,669 --> 00:08:06,740
And warning has to be given now. Very important is at this juncture when Sahaja Yoga is now taking off,

42
00:08:06,749 --> 00:08:13,500
remember this, the speed has been gained and it is taking off. Those who will

43
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:23,690
be left behind, will be left behind. So don't get into bumptiousness. First is your character,

44
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:38,890
as everybody says, "They are very bumptious." Try to be humble and then understand that

45
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:50,990
you have to be in the plane and not left behind on the grounds. It is moving fast.

46
00:08:50,999 --> 00:09:04,310
Now the most fortunate thing is that today is the Navaratri and that I should be in London

47
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:12,060
and this Navaratri Puja should be performed here. No other country is that privileged,

48
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:34,480
because this is the highest Puja, the greatest ritual, which you can attend. So why do we do Navaratri?

49
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:52,420
In the heart, to do Navaratri is to accept the powers of the Shakti, to realize the power

50
00:09:52,429 --> 00:10:01,320
that all these chakras have got in themselves, and that when they are enlightened how you

51
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:09,440
can express all these powers of these nine chakras within ourselves; the seven chakras

52
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:15,220
plus the heart and the moon makes it nine. But I would say that seven of these and on

53
00:10:15,229 --> 00:10:21,770
top of that, we should say two more centers, which Blake has described surprisingly as nine centers,

54
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:28,850
clearly. Just now I cannot talk of the higher two centers, but let us at least

55
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:40,630
talk of the seven centers. The power of these centers, have we been able to develop within ourselves?

56
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:51,680
How can you do it? You have no time. You are all busy people, and bumptious.

57
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:59,570
So now to develop these powers we have to concentrate on these chakras.

58
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:05,627
Everywhere I went, I was surprised, the questions they asked Me, the way they were.

59
00:11:05,627 --> 00:11:16,963
Nobody talked about their family, house, jobs or any other nonsensical things like unemployment and all that.

60
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:23,379
They just asked Me, "Mother, how do we develop the power of this chakra,

61
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:29,320
or that chakra or that chakra?" And I asked them, "How is it you are asking about a particular chakra?"

62
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:39,000
They said, "Because we find this is missing in us, specially in me this one is not all right."

63
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:53,433
(Mother speaks aside) This is another negativity to make My throat all right.

64
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:30,750
Now for a Realized Soul there is no need for Me to discipline you or to tell you all these things,

65
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,980
because I hate to talk in this tone to you today. But I have discovered that if

66
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:51,170
I do not warn you now, tomorrow you will blame Me that I did not warn you. Take it as a serious warning.

67
00:12:51,179 --> 00:13:00,950
Now after Realization there is no need for Me to discipline you at all,

68
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:11,690
because you have got the light, you have known what is Realization, you have known what it means

69
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:18,212
to be Realized, and you have also known how much you have gained out of it,

70
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:24,294
how much your personality has improved.

71
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:36,680
But there is something more that has to be done. Is to see for yourself, if you have

72
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:43,800
really disciplined yourself or not. There is no need for any leader to tell you,

73
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:52,480
 there is no need for any ashram fellow to tell you, there is no need for anyone to tell you.

74
00:13:52,489 --> 00:14:00,337
It is you, who is a Realized Soul, you are your own master, you are your own guru.

75
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:12,432
Imagine you are all gurus, great gurus and Sadgurus, respected Saints where all the angels have

76
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:22,230
to shower you with flowers. Think of it. And here you are bumptiously giving lectures,

77
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:30,572
talking bumptiously. Very embarrassing even for the deities. They don't know what to do,

78
00:14:30,572 --> 00:14:44,784
whether to garland you or to shut your mouth. Here you are who have been,

79
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:12,457
here you are in such a great position that you have got Realization. That only thing you have to accept:

80
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:29,835
the beauty of this great Yoga, that you just enlighten your own powers, which are on these seven chakras.

81
00:15:29,835 --> 00:15:40,974
Now let us see the first chakra, belongs to the power of Gauri, the power of the Mother

82
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:53,118
of Shri Ganesh. Gauri's power. Tremendous they are, aren't they? Because of Her power

83
00:15:53,189 --> 00:16:04,660
you have got your Realization. Now what have we done to enshrine that power within ourselves?

84
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:16,740
Today, if it is the first day of Navaratri, let us see what have we done? Have we been

85
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:30,330
able to develop our innocence within ourselves? When people talk, they are so sharp. How can

86
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:38,950
you be sharp if you are innocent? They are so bumptious. How can you be that if you are innocent?

87
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:47,320
People play games. How can you do that if you are innocent? Harm each other.

88
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:55,230
How can it be, if you are innocent? So first of all you have to see yourself, that the

89
00:16:55,239 --> 00:17:05,320
power of innocence, if it has to live, all the rest of the nonsense has to go away.

90
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:14,660
 If you want to have the innocence, all that is anti-innocence has to be dropped out.

91
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:21,160
I can understand about people, who are ignorant, who have ignorance. Then in ignorance,

92
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:26,000
of course how will they talk of innocence. But you are not ignorant people.

93
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:29,327
You are knowledgeable,you've got your Enlightenment.

94
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:35,375
And the power of innocence is so great. It makes you absolutely fearless, not bumptious but fearless.

95
00:17:37,064 --> 00:17:47,806
you are in a big fool's paradise, as they call it, riding a fast horse, all that is there is all right,

96
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:58,490
is forgiven. But once you have seen the light, you must try to get rid of all the snakes

97
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:06,740
that you have been holding on to - is a simple thing.

98
00:18:06,749 --> 00:18:16,670
In your childlike nature only, you can receive the blessings of Gauri, otherwise you cannot.

99
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:24,690
You have to be really childlike, otherwise it is absolutely useless, no use telling you anything,

100
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:29,110
because you think you're too clever. To such a person, who thinks he is too clever,

101
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:35,940
what's the use of talking to such a person, because he already knows everything.

102
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:41,220
So the first power when you develop, you must learn to sit on the Mother Earth, first of all.

103
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:49,190
You must respect the Mother Earth, because the first chakra is made out of the Mother Earth.

104
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:58,524
Try to be more settled down with yourself on Mother Earth. And the respect.

105
00:18:58,524 --> 00:19:09,935
See the trees when they get their flowers, they are not so respectful, but when they are laden by the fruits,

106
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:20,094
they bow down to Mother Earth. In the same way when you have got the fruits

107
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:28,690
of Sahaja Yoga, you all must bow down.

108
00:19:28,699 --> 00:19:41,250
And innocence has a special capacity to make a person extremely peaceful, extremely peaceful.

109
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:55,001
All the anger, temper, violence. If a person doesn't have innocence, it cannot come in it,

110
00:19:55,001 --> 00:20:05,416
because a person who is not innocent is either sly or aggressive. He cannot have peace

111
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:12,635
within his heart. But a innocent person is not bothered, innocently he lives, he enjoys

112
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:26,855
everything in complete peace and harmony. But this violence comes when a person becomes clever.

113
00:20:27,855 --> 00:20:33,030
He thinks, "I am so clever, the another one is so stupid, I have a right to shout

114
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:43,720
at that person." And the one who is not innocent is never wise. He may be, to look at, look sharp,

115
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:53,064
but he is not wise. Wisdom comes only with innocence. And how much wisdom have you gathered?

116
00:20:53,064 --> 00:20:59,559
 That is what one has to see.

117
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:11,020
When your power of innocence increases, wisdom is apparent. People say, "That fellow is very wise."

118
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:19,170
For example if somebody is crying about his wife, a wise person will say,

119
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:24,870
"Oh Baba! just look at this, still busy with his wife." Another one is crying about his house or something.

120
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:34,970
He will say, "Oh! look at this one still busy with the house." There is no end to it.

121
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:46,720
I've known people who get so swollen up that they think they must give a big lecture for

122
00:21:46,729 --> 00:21:54,750
one hour, on Sahaja Yoga. Unless and until, they have given one hour lecture, they do

123
00:21:54,759 --> 00:22:03,610
not think their ego has manifested itself fully. But a wise person, he doesn't have

124
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:14,570
to talk or speak or do anything. He impresses his silence, his wisdom on others much more easily.

125
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:23,070
That is what we have to see. Have we been able to discipline ourselves?

126
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:30,851
 Because our growth is very much in the beginning of it. We have to grow quite a lot.

127
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:41,244
And people don't understand this point in an atmosphere of egoistical temperament that you have to grow,

128
00:22:41,244 --> 00:22:51,452
you have not yet grown. You have to grow a lot. And when you grow you find this

129
00:22:51,709 --> 00:23:04,510
wisdom really fragrant with compassion. Your wisdom is fragrant with compassion. Such beautiful

130
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:14,367
compassion can emit through your being, that anybody who comes in contact with you,

131
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:28,646
will feel your auspiciousness. But, again you must give due respect to your Self Realization

132
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:35,070
and to your Self. That is the first thing you have to do, is to meditate.

133
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:40,360
Somebody sent Me a letter and I saw the vibrations were horrid. I said, "What's the matter with

134
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:46,890
this gentleman? His vibrations are so horrid, what is he doing?" Then I found out that he

135
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:52,971
says he doesn't need any meditation. He has already reached the fourteenth heaven,

136
00:23:52,971 --> 00:24:00,570
so he doesn't need any meditation, doesn't have to do any meditation. It is easy to explain,

137
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:11,800
but whom are you explaining? You have to explain to yourself, only yourself nobody else wants

138
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:17,740
your explanation. It's like missing the plane. When you miss the plane whom are you going

139
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:26,490
to explain the plane has left. So then you have to explain yourself only. You will tell

140
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:34,990
the air, or to the gangway, or anything that, "Oh baba, it happened like that. There was

141
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:43,030
this thing, I had no time, there was a jam, this, that." But the plane is gone.

142
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:49,530
Whom are you explaining?

143
00:24:49,539 --> 00:25:00,830
So everyone should meditate everyday. That is a very important thing, which people are

144
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:09,750
doing in all the countries where I am not. Because I am in England, people take Me for granted:

145
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:15,920
"Mother is doing everything." So I get up at 4 O'clock, take My bath, meditate

146
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:22,120
for you all. I better start doing that again. Otherwise you have no time to meditate.

147
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:25,870
So at least let Me meditate for your sake.

148
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:33,380
So everyone must today promise to Me that they will meditate everyday. Get up in the morning.

149
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:42,990
"We can't get up in the morning." The whole world can get up, why not the English?

150
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:48,750
But when it was the war of Waterloo, they were the first to arrive there. They won the

151
00:25:48,759 --> 00:26:00,980
war because they were so punctual. What has happened to their punctuality today?

152
00:26:00,989 --> 00:26:13,940
We are not drinking, we do not have hangovers, we don't sleep late, so why shouldn't we decide today that,

153
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:21,940
"Every morning I'll get up and do my meditation. And while meditating I must

154
00:26:21,949 --> 00:26:29,130
concentrate on myself and not on others. And see for myself what is catching, where am

155
00:26:29,139 --> 00:26:33,630
I catching, which chakra I am catching, what have I to do?"

156
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:44,450
So on this day of Navaratri, today as the first day, the Gauri's power must be enlightened

157
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:50,980
within us, and they must express. And they are tremendous. I cannot describe them in one lecture.

158
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:59,660
Think of the Primordial Kundalini. She acts in the Mother Earth, She acts in

159
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:08,850
the universe, She acts in the animals, She acts in the matter, She acts in the human beings,

160
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:21,890
and now She acts in you. She is the One who decides the face and the figure that

161
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:27,670
you are going to have. She is the One who decides what child you should have. She is

162
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:35,140
the One who gives you the particular type of a child that you need. She is the One who

163
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:41,290
has got you all these beautiful children. She is the One who has given you these sparkling

164
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:49,020
faces and sparkling eyes. All this She has done for you, but what about the power that

165
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:55,370
you have within yourself. How much have you manifested that?

166
00:27:55,379 --> 00:28:01,490
The Primordial is working very hard, no doubt. But what about you, the individuals, who have

167
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:09,110
got their own Kundalini awakened? How far you have opened Her out. And what is Kundalini?

168
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:16,470
- is a simple thing as you know, is the true desire. So true desire to perfect yourself,

169
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:28,890
to grow yourself. If it is really true desire nothing else is important. All other desires

170
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:36,900
are secondary and tertiary. The most important desire is to grow. And for whose advantage?

171
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:43,610
Is the advantage of yours and in your advantage only the advantage of the whole world rests.

172
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:52,750
Sahaja Yogis today represent the growth of this universe, the growth of the human race.

173
00:28:52,759 --> 00:29:01,820
Do you follow this point that you are playing such an important role, role at such a crucial

174
00:29:01,829 --> 00:29:15,740
time when the world is about to collapse? And you have great seers like William Blake,

175
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:24,260
you had such great people who have talked about this time. They have built it up, traditionally

176
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:35,610
we have built up all this. Now in England, the work of ages that has brought this England

177
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:54,880
to this state. Now do you realize that the position of English Sahaja Yogis is very important.

178
00:29:54,889 --> 00:30:09,720
But lack of wisdom and bumptiousness without understanding your Self, how can you talk so loud?

179
00:30:09,729 --> 00:30:24,630
How can you think of organizing everything when you yourself are so weak, so bumptious?

180
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:34,750
So today I am not going to take the count of the people, who meditate everyday or not.

181
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:40,298
But I can tell you this much, next year those who do not meditate everyday,

182
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:49,979
he will not be here anymore. Take it from Me, is a fact.

183
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:57,124
Everyday you must meditate. Discipline yourself.

184
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:06,990
Now you have come to a new perspective. You have come to a new vision. Now when you see

185
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:25,860
that vision, when you know the vision, you cannot just stand there. Get into it.

186
00:31:25,869 --> 00:31:33,130
Everyone says, Damley was saying too, everybody says that, "Mother you have spent so much

187
00:31:33,139 --> 00:31:51,320
time for these English. Why so much time for them?" May be you might be thinking that because

188
00:31:51,329 --> 00:32:00,010
you are very great, that's why I have to serve you people. Think the way you like. But the

189
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:07,320
most important thing is that you are on the land of Heart, and I have to cleanse you more,

190
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:14,620
much more than others. But it's just the other way round. Others are going so fast. I am amazed,

191
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:20,980
their vibrations, their sensitivity, their understanding. And they have just mastered it;

192
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:33,360
every one of them. Here, it is becoming a very centralized stuff and everybody doesn't

193
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:41,630
want to understand Sahaja Yoga, but everyone wants to give a lecture. There is no respect

194
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:53,140
for elders. No respect who is older who is younger, and somebody who thinks that because

195
00:32:53,149 --> 00:32:58,070
they got Realization before others, they are higher, then remember one word of Christ,

196
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:14,450
that, "First will be the last."  So try to understand that it is you who has to grow, it is you who has to manifest these

197
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:19,990
powers. Manifestation of the powers, I don't know how far you have understood.

198
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:27,910
When a person who has Gauri's power, as soon as he enters a hall or any place, everybody's

199
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:46,230
Kundalini rises, just to salute. When you have Gauri's power then you stand out because

200
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:56,110
you have that innocent, lustless, greedless, beautiful, sparkling eyes and wherever you

201
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:05,260
turn your eyes, even one glance would raise the Kundalini immediately. People who suffer

202
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:10,540
from cancer, suffer from this disease, that disease, all can be cured in no time if you

203
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:23,750
have developed only one power of Gauri. All your problems can be solved. Negativity will

204
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:39,520
go away and you will become like a lotus. Beautiful, fragrant, overpowering all kinds of negativity.

205
00:34:39,529 --> 00:34:50,400
Here it is, "That fellow just touched me and now I have become egoistical." If there is

206
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:54,400
one fellow who is egoistical, he just talks to another person, the person goes egoistical.

207
00:34:54,409 --> 00:35:01,390
I mean this is not the way to be sensitive. You have to be sensitive to God and not to

208
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:13,190
bad things. But we are more akin, more vulnerable to bad than to good.

209
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:24,290
So the power, the power of assimilation of good, the power of emission of good, all these

210
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:36,890
powers are just in your complete reach. But all this should not become a praise but should

211
00:35:36,899 --> 00:35:47,790
become a kind of a challenge, a kind of a beautiful curiosity and an advancement for you.

212
00:35:47,799 --> 00:35:56,180
But we are going down, I must tell you, we are going down in England. Because we have

213
00:35:56,189 --> 00:36:02,600
some funny tags, funny people who are all the time with tags. Such people will have

214
00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:12,310
to be warned, and later on may be declared, as these people have decided, should be declared

215
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:22,470
as black listed. It's a very sad day today for Me and that is why the whole place is

216
00:36:22,479 --> 00:36:27,110
filled with; I mean I had no mind to have the Puja here, because I am really very sad.

217
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,030
Because when I see the vibrations, when I see the way things are, people are just in

218
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:37,850
a picnic way in England, I feel so unhappy, you don't know.

219
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:53,220
I have always been extremely enamored, and I have already put up a big show of appreciating

220
00:36:53,229 --> 00:37:04,130
your efforts. But if you see in the substance of it; just see the substance, you watch within yourself.

221
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:11,540
Each individual should see the substance that is within us. We are worried about a friend,

222
00:37:11,549 --> 00:37:19,820
a fianc¨¦ or a wife or a husband or this and that. That's not the caliber.

223
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:32,726
The caliber is very low and is going down lower. That's not a good thing, is not good.

224
00:37:32,726 --> 00:37:40,068
 If My love and compassion is spoiling you I better pull you out of it. Because you are capable

225
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:47,630
of your merits to be born in this country. You are capable of very great heights. I know that.

226
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:56,730
 Of very great heights, which you can achieve. But not by talking about it or thinking

227
00:37:56,739 --> 00:38:08,540
about it, but by becoming that great power, to become that power. And see the collective

228
00:38:08,549 --> 00:38:13,020
blessings people have and I was amazed when they told Me, they have got this blessing,

229
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:22,280
they have got that blessing. I mean unlimited blessings they have got. And why can't we

230
00:38:22,289 --> 00:38:31,630
have that here? What's the problem with us? If we are not collective, if there is a problem

231
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:37,290
between ourselves, that means there is some sort of an ego still in-between that is keeping us out.

232
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:45,907
So let us now, promise within our heart that this has to go into our heart, a very deep feeling for ourselves...

233
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:49,700
If you see in your previous lives, you have had all kinds of foods,

234
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:54,236
you have had all kinds of trips, you have done every kind of marriages,

235
00:38:54,289 --> 00:39:01,230
you have done every kind of other nonsensical thing that people waste time with. It is over

236
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:08,210
now, finished. Now you do something new. How many people you have married in previous lives

237
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:15,520
and how many houses you had in previous lives and how many pleasures you have had, finished now. Finish it.

238
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:28,689
This is a special time, the best time of Ritambhara where you have to grow. That's the point,

239
00:39:28,689 --> 00:39:39,712
the season is that. In this season if you do not grow, you won't grow. You have to take full advantage.

240
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:49,327
With full intensity you have to do Sahaja Yoga. That doesn't mean that

241
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:53,800
you give up your jobs, or anything. If you are intense in Sahaja Yoga, you will be intense

242
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:57,080
in everything. But there is no intensity.

243
00:39:57,089 --> 00:40:02,760
Munich I decided just, I don't know if Warren has told you, Munich (aside) "You didn't tell

244
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:08,270
them about Munich?" All right Munich. I decided at last minute, because there was a horrid

245
00:40:08,279 --> 00:40:15,220
one who had come from Munich and had told Me that Munich's seekers will ask such questions.

246
00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:20,050
I didn't like them at all. She was very arrogant. I said I am not going to Munich. But in Vienna

247
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:26,490
I just felt the vibrations of Munich. And I was amazed. I said, "All right , I am going

248
00:40:26,499 --> 00:40:31,240
to Munich." We had to run up and down to get My visa, this thing. Everything worked out

249
00:40:31,249 --> 00:40:41,080
as usual. And in that short time, three days, four hundred people were there. And so intense

250
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:48,780
I tell you, so intense, even children, so intense, and they were listening to every

251
00:40:48,789 --> 00:40:58,190
word I was saying, and picking up as pearls, precious as diamonds, every word they were

252
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:04,040
noting it down. And when they had their Realization they were just stunned people. Imagine the Germans,

253
00:41:04,049 --> 00:41:12,550
coming over you people, English. What will happen to you? They are people of

254
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:18,030
determination. If they decide to do good, they'll do lot of good. They are not like this.

255
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:28,940
And then when I left them, for one hour, they were in the hall, just stunned,

256
00:41:28,949 --> 00:41:36,140
discussing about Sahaja Yoga.

257
00:41:36,149 --> 00:41:42,310
But here as soon as I go away, people start discussing something so nonsensical. I hear it.

258
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:50,150
I know the vibrations and everything. We are not intense, we must increase our intensity.

259
00:41:50,159 --> 00:42:04,380
That is what is called as shraddha. Is important, very important. And I am sure this year you

260
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:16,660
will make it a point to do intense understanding of Sahaja Yoga. That intensity is lacking.

261
00:42:16,669 --> 00:42:23,530
May be there is something gone wrong with you in the past and you are conditioned about it,

262
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:34,050
or you think about it. You can do it, everything, you forget the past, forget the past.

263
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:45,630
 Past has no meaning whatsoever in Sahaja Yoga. You are being completely renovated but

264
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:52,210
just use your mechanism. I have worked so hard with you people that nothing wrong with

265
00:42:52,219 --> 00:42:59,280
your mechanism. Only thing you have no faith in yourself. And those who do not have faith

266
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:07,490
in themselves are always bumptious people. So first of all station yourself within your Spirit,

267
00:43:07,499 --> 00:43:17,020
within your heart and try to develop your powers, inner powers, not of talking

268
00:43:17,029 --> 00:43:20,920
and showing off, but inner powers.

269
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:34,090
Still so many are possessed, you know that. It's a shameful thing that even now in the

270
00:43:34,099 --> 00:43:44,814
temple of God there are people who are possessed by horrible evil things. How can  it be?

271
00:43:44,814 --> 00:44:24,669


272
00:44:24,852 --> 00:44:28,627
They do not talk at all or they eat not at all.

273
00:44:28,627 --> 00:44:34,219
All this is indiscipline. But going higher to this spiritual life,

274
00:44:34,219 --> 00:44:39,690
best thing is to take the discipline from your Spirit and you are disciplined automatically.

275
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:51,430
Let the Spirit rule you. It's possible because I have seen in such a short time and when

276
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:58,100
I have been there for such a short time, I don't even know their names. Here practically

277
00:44:58,109 --> 00:45:06,090
I know all of you, by your names, and by your vibrations also. And they have gone up so much.

278
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:17,190
So, today is a great day. Of course a great privilege. Always you are privileged people,

279
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:24,430
like House of Lords. Is true, but may be, one day may come when this House of Lords

280
00:45:24,439 --> 00:45:35,910
may be banished completely. You have to behave like Lords. That is why My humble request

281
00:45:35,919 --> 00:45:45,410
is that you must learn to worship discipline. I don't say, "Do this, do that," you know

282
00:45:45,419 --> 00:45:51,630
what is to be done. And then on top of that, you should not tell Me, "I know, I should

283
00:45:51,639 --> 00:46:01,930
have, I know." When you know, why don't you do it? You are empowered. Today let us, with

284
00:46:01,939 --> 00:46:10,030
full confidence in ourselves and in our ascent, let us with full intensity attend this Puja

285
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:14,831
and in our hearts decide that, "I am going to discipline myself."

286
00:46:18,743 --> 00:46:20,054
May God bless you!
