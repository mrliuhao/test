1
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,000
Where am I?

2
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,709
Where should I go?

3
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:32,769
Am I lost? I’m confused.

4
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:38,108
I can hear something… It’s as 
if there are two forces within me,

5
00:00:38,108 --> 00:00:40,000
like two 

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,260
wolves.

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,999
Sometimes I feel determined, 
I don’t give in,

8
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,320
I’m intelligent,

9
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:00,099
shrewd, capable, but then I become

10
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:02,509
angry and aggressive:

11
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:06,639
I keep arguing with everyone, without
having to real reason.

12
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:10,139
I look for trouble everywhere and 
I find it easily.

13
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,360
At other times I’m gentle,

14
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,999
understanding, affectionate

15
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:17,329
and generous but 

16
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:21,439
then everything scares me. 
I become lazy, 

17
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,399
sad, introverted and I can’t see 
the beauty 

18
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:28,939
in anything.

19
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:32,679
It’s difficult to live like this! 

20
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:36,859
I need to be determined, brave and to
never give up.

21
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:40,458
But also to be intuitive, 

22
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,679
alert

23
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:47,219
and to have eyes that 
can see in the dark.

24
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,380
The world 

25
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:52,909
is in turmoil.

26
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:55,589
Maybe because we are never satisfied?

27
00:01:55,589 --> 00:02:00,489
Our mind’s are never content and 
this creates friction,

28
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:04,509
conflict, division, tension,

29
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:08,489
racism,  intolerance,

30
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,079
fear  and violence… We continuously 
desire things 

31
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:18,258
that give us superficial satisfaction 
and that only appease us temporarily;

32
00:02:18,258 --> 00:02:21,429
our all society is founded 

33
00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:23,119
upon this principle.

34
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:27,829
 

35
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,680
We are slaves to a form of 
continuous greed:

36
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:36,499
we want to possess everything. 
We desperately desire something

37
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,240
but as soon as we have it, 

38
00:02:40,249 --> 00:02:46,179
it soon looses its importance and our attentions 
rapidly moves to other objects,

39
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:50,979
other goals, but in the end we 
never feel fully satisfied.

40
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,659
We talk about world peace, 

41
00:02:54,659 --> 00:03:00,379
so why do we still have wars?
How can humanity achieve peace, 

42
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:03,829
if we can’t feel it within… 
within our souls?

43
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,019
The solution needs to be 
found inside of us!

44
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:12,669
In a complete transformation of the inner being. why?

45
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:16,669
Because it is not possible to establish peace

46
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:20,738
in the world if individuals are not 
in harmony with themselves.

47
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,618
Today a solution exists, that 
is available for everyone.

48
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:31,719
There is an energy that acts in the 
deepest and most profound part of each of us, 

49
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:36,859
it’s a female energy that resides
in the sacrum bone:

50
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:43,859
she’s known as Kundalini.
How can this energy help us?

51
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:47,758
By spontaneously awakening 
itself within us,

52
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,839
She dissolves any inner difficulties 
or tensions.

53
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:55,949
It’s not something you should just 
believe in,

54
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:00,238
the Kundalini actually 
activates a energetic system

55
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,600
that we can physically feel.

56
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:09,569
Inner peace

57
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,799
Inner peace

58
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,420
Inner peace? That's cool! Inner peace of what?

59
00:04:18,429 --> 00:04:22,248
It is the next phase of your training.
Every master

60
00:04:22,248 --> 00:04:25,609
must find his path

61
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:29,218
to inner peace. Some choose to meditate for fifty
years

62
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:34,269
in a cave just like this without the
slightest taste

63
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:37,699
of food or water.

64
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:41,609
Or? Sometimes it's through pain and
suffering as I did.

65
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:44,648
Po the day you were chosen as Dragon
warrior

66
00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:52,988
was the worst day of my life. But once I
realized the problem

67
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:57,058
was not you but within me I found inner peace

68
00:04:57,058 --> 00:05:00,558
and was able to harness the flow of the universe.

69
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:09,938
Inner peace may be achieved 
thanks to the Kundalini

70
00:05:09,938 --> 00:05:13,938
that awakens innate qualities 
within the human being 

71
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:17,968
such as respect for each other, tolerance, 

72
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:23,079
solidarity and she permits us 
to establish 

73
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:28,479
a state of harmony and consistency that helps 
us to move in the best direction. 

74
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,600
On the 21st March 1923 

75
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:39,338
a very special personality was born 
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

76
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:43,179
promoter of a subtle and deep inner revolution.

77
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:47,659
A unique figure, 
who undeniably deserves to be nominated

78
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:50,459
among the great personalities of 
this century like

79
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,019
Gandhi, Martin Luther King 
and Nelson Mandela.

80
00:05:55,019 --> 00:06:00,109
Shri Mataji, in fact, not only spread 
the message of peace,

81
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:03,259
or fought for social change.

82
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:09,139
She went beyond, directly to the 
root of human problems:

83
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:13,688
She found the key to inner transformation 

84
00:06:13,688 --> 00:06:17,088
 through the spontaneous awakening 
 of the Kundalini.

85
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,940
When the Kundalini rises, 

86
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:24,919
She connects with the all-pervading energy

87
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,278
and it is through this union that we experience 

88
00:06:28,278 --> 00:06:29,598
inner peace.

89
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,300
Such a beautiful power

90
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,740
is all-pervading,

91
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,880
into every atom and

92
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,360
into every living primule

93
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,540
into every living being.

94
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,139
It acts so beautifully that we don’t even

95
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,379
 feel the smoothness of it. We don’t even see

96
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:01,029
a flower flowering, blossoming opening, we don’t see that.

97
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:06,869
It just blossoms and we say, “Oh, today there is a flower.” 

98
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,060
It just so sweetly, so beautifully,

99
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,439
that we do not even feel the existence of it 

100
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,580
in any way – but it exists.

101
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:23,000
And unless and until we are connected with that power

102
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,280
we cannot know the ultimate reality

103
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:34,289
because the spirit within us is not in our attention.

104
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,659
It’s the Kundalini that helps us calm 

105
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:54,999
our continuous mental activity, 
all these excessive thoughts 

106
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:58,099
that fill our minds and make 
us react badly!

107
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,200
They constantly take us to the future 

108
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:08,609
or to the past preventing us from 
living the reality of the present.

109
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,500
Preventing us from being 

110
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:17,049
in the moment.

111
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,318
So I believe that in everyone of us

112
00:10:02,318 --> 00:10:05,829
we have inside of us

113
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:08,889
all the truth and the knowledge that we need to grow

114
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,459
and I think that with meditation that's the only way

115
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,000
I can actually get connected with this truth and this knowledge

116
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,779
So I meditate so I can grow and

117
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,920
so I can evolve.I think everybody needs to evolve. What's the point of stopping?

118
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,160
I meditate

119
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:31,519
because I want to feel the

120
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,439
inner joy. I felt it.

121
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:36,569
I want to fell it again and again 

122
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:40,869
I meditate because it helps me be a more balanced person

123
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,300
and it helps me with my studies

124
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,920
And it's very very joyful when

125
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,600
you reach that state, where you're not thinking at all

126
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,300
and you can just witness everything

127
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,920
Why I meditate? I believe and I feel that

128
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,880
since I started meditating, everything has changed

129
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,860
everything around you changes, not just inwardly

130
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,840
but everything around you changes, the people...

131
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,600
It's the best thing that happened in my life.

132
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:33,019
Basically this energy rises, goes through all our chakras

133
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,280
comes out through our fontanel and connects everyone.

134
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:42,020
And that's the reason why we are able to feel this freedom, this peace.

135
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,520
It connects each individual, we are all connected through this energy

136
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,340
losing all thoughts that had come to your mind...

137
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,080
It's simply the nicest feeling that one can have

138
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,540
it makes me relax, feel very calm and achieve inner peace.

139
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:06,260
It give me peace. I feel more peaceful when I meditate and also it helps me to get into a state of... 

140
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,819
stay in the center.

141
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,080
It gives me the capacity to understand

142
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:14,628
who I am and who I can become.

143
00:12:14,628 --> 00:12:17,899
Sahaja Yoga can be anything you want,

144
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:22,699
because it hasn't actually any limitations.
