1
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:44,544
Today, we are going to do Puja for Navaratri.

2
00:00:52,479 --> 00:01:02,504
Yesterday you saw a beautiful description of Navaratri, and how the Mother Goddess has

3
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:14,712
created all kinds of powers within you. It's not that only She has the powers,

4
00:01:14,712 --> 00:01:25,153
but you all have the powers and you can all work it out. You can all find out whether these powers

5
00:01:25,162 --> 00:01:40,733
are there or not. With us the Realization is very important, but there the Kundalini

6
00:01:40,742 --> 00:01:52,053
has given you this Realization. Of course Kundalini is a part, or we can say reflection,

7
00:01:52,062 --> 00:02:09,813
of Adi Shakti, and also

8
00:02:09,822 --> 00:02:36,343
the Jagadamba is also part of Adi Shakti.

9
00:02:36,352 --> 00:02:51,943
She is placed in the center of two Hearts, which is a very important point.

10
00:02:51,952 --> 00:03:07,813
Now, all these powers are placed in that Chakra. So you imagine how many of these powers must be.

11
00:03:07,822 --> 00:03:23,343
And Her powers are expressed through the center Heart in all the Ganas you have around your body.

12
00:03:23,352 --> 00:03:36,303
Now these Ganas are the ones who do give you the protection, give you the sleep,

13
00:03:36,312 --> 00:03:45,453
give you the energy, give you the blessings - all of them are at work all the time - and these

14
00:03:45,462 --> 00:04:03,793
bodies are extremely dedicated and connected all the time to the Mother Amba: we can call, Jagadamba.

15
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:12,693
Now She is the Mother of the universe; so you can imagine it, how busy She has to be

16
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:28,583
to look after the whole universe. When this center becomes weak, that means Her connection

17
00:04:28,592 --> 00:04:42,403
with the Ganas is reduced. Ganas also are weak, and all the powers that could be exercised,

18
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:57,213
cannot be done because of this weakness. It's a very subtle center because it is Mother's center;

19
00:04:57,222 --> 00:05:08,193
is impossible to understand the love of Mother. It's absolutely impossible.

20
00:05:08,202 --> 00:05:14,613
When the girls get married, and they become mothers, then they start understanding how much their

21
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:25,393
mother must have done for them to come up. In the same way when Sahaja Yogis become good Sahaja Yogis,

22
00:05:25,402 --> 00:05:36,693
like Ganas, they realize how much the Ganas had to have patience,

23
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:47,973
had to have love and intelligence, to fight the negativity. So all the forces of the Jagadamba act towards

24
00:05:47,982 --> 00:05:51,493
hitting the negativity of all kinds.

25
00:05:51,502 --> 00:06:01,743
That is Her first and foremost nature - is to destroy all the negativity that is in this

26
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:15,963
world and is against Sahaj, against you. Her destruction takes place in so many ways.

27
00:06:15,972 --> 00:06:26,723
First of all, we have to know that if you sin against the Goddess, then all kinds of physical start problems

28
00:06:26,732 --> 00:06:41,553
- like psychosomatic diseases, all kinds: we can say cancer, AIDS, all of them.

29
00:06:41,562 --> 00:06:53,213
But some of the diseases have got also the mixed up with the Ganapati. Now Ganapati is the

30
00:06:53,222 --> 00:07:02,123
Lord of all the Ganas. So, the Mother has Ganapati, and She controls all these Ganas

31
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:13,613
through her son Ganapati. It is so connected. So the sin against the Mother when we do - means

32
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:25,213
when we become immoral. Immoral means when we start indulging into things which are not

33
00:07:25,222 --> 00:07:34,553
permitted by dharma. By dharma whatever is permitted is the legal. Now you people understand

34
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:40,343
Sahaj dharma innately, from within. I didn't have to tell you. Now you know this is wrong,

35
00:07:40,352 --> 00:07:50,333
is wrong, this is right, this is right. So any such things when you try to do,

36
00:07:50,342 --> 00:07:58,523
because She is a Mother, She takes time to punish you. No doubt. But if you commit a sin against the Father,

37
00:07:58,532 --> 00:08:05,693
like boastfulness, talking big, being cruel, harsh and all that - immediately

38
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:15,443
the punishment comes in. But from Her, She being the Ocean of compassion, the punishment

39
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:27,973
is more delayed, and a full chance is given to the person to improve himself and guide himself.

40
00:08:27,982 --> 00:08:38,699
But when the punishment starts, then you get into diseases which are of a very serious nature.

41
00:08:40,372 --> 00:08:52,743
So it comes from one thing, what we call as fear. When somebody frightens you or aggresses you,

42
00:08:52,752 --> 00:09:03,283
or becomes like a maskit as they say; somebody who is oppressed by aggressive people

43
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:18,103
or is threatened, intimidated, then a person starts losing faith in the powers of Mother.

44
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:25,127
As a result, such a person ...

45
00:10:48,803 --> 00:10:54,228
So this center Heart is to be looked after.

46
00:10:54,228 --> 00:11:04,530
Out of fear, if somebody is thrown on to the left side, away from the Mother,

47
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:13,821
 because She is the one who gives us confidence, who gives us courage and bravery.

48
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:24,443
But if you are frightened, or if you are under fear, also you can be thrown to the left side;

49
00:11:24,452 --> 00:11:30,943
and you can get into all kind of diseases which are very serious, incurable as they call them.

50
00:11:30,952 --> 00:11:46,203
Another thing is if you are driven by your senses into indulgences without any dharma,

51
00:11:46,212 --> 00:11:59,013
then also this central path throws away, you can say, you to the left side,

52
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:13,493
because you are not worthy of being at the lotus Feet of  the Mother. Now, this center is the one which

53
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:20,293
when we are afraid, the sternum bone starts moving like a remote control and informs all

54
00:12:20,302 --> 00:12:29,833
the Ganas that the attack is coming. But when you deliberately go to the left side,

55
00:12:29,842 --> 00:12:38,253
and get into indulgences, then they are not bothered. They said: "All right, go ahead, do what you like;

56
00:12:38,262 --> 00:12:47,023
you can behave the way you want to behave." All these different types of movements towards the left,

57
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:52,583
takes you away from your Mother.

58
00:12:52,592 --> 00:13:01,263
I'll tell you a story about somebody in America. He is a very old Sahaja Yogi, Indian.

59
00:13:01,272 --> 00:13:09,374
He came out of his shop, where he was working, and got into his car - there was one man sitting with a dagger.

60
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:14,478
And he hit him with the dagger on the center Heart. And this fellow started bleeding.

61
00:13:14,478 --> 00:13:19,794
He said, " I don't know what happened to me, Mother. I got such strength,

62
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:24,716
I caught hold of him and I started fighting with him, and I took the dagger from him.

63
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:32,180
He had the handle and the dagger came into my hand. And the fellow ran away.

64
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:41,234
But still I was not worried about my bleeding. What I did - I called my colleague who was coming out of the car,

65
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:46,114
I ran after him and he took me in his car for half-an-hour searching that fellow."

66
00:13:46,114 --> 00:13:48,530
They didn't go to the police.

67
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:54,185
And then they went to the police. The police was surprised - the whole shirt was full of blood.

68
00:13:54,185 --> 00:13:59,929
He said, "Nobody would believe." Even the police was shocked. "For half an hour

69
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:03,430
you were searching this fellow. Why didn't you come to the police?" He said,

70
00:14:03,502 --> 00:14:09,113
"It would have taken half-an-hour for you to come, so we thought, better do it ourselves." See the courage!

71
00:14:09,122 --> 00:14:17,303
Then, of course, he was taken to the hospital, and he was all right.

72
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:25,473
Just they stitched him up. But he is all right. That is the sign of a person who can never get

73
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:34,824
any one of these horrible diseases, because there is no fear in his mind, of any kind.

74
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:40,784
And, he is an Indian, he said: "I have never even slapped my own children. I have never

75
00:14:40,852 --> 00:14:47,431
fought with anyone. I am not a wrestler by any chance, nothing of the kind. But it happened."

76
00:14:47,431 --> 00:14:52,955
He says, " I don't know how, from where I got this shakti; and how I did it, I just don't know."

77
00:14:54,482 --> 00:15:00,263
There are many stories like this they can tell you about Sahaja Yogis, and about so

78
00:15:00,272 --> 00:15:13,353
many saints, how they were never afraid of attacking someone when somebody attacks them,

79
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:19,993
or of protecting themselves from all kinds of horrible things with their courage.

80
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:27,393
This is something one cannot believe sometimes, but it is happening, every day, I get letters

81
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:34,213
from people how they have been courageous. If you believe in the Goddess, then know that

82
00:15:34,222 --> 00:15:42,033
She is extremely powerful; She is very intelligent; and if She has to protect you, She will protect

83
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:49,933
you out and out, in such a way that you will not know how you have been protected.

84
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:55,663
But this faith has to be developed. Faith has to be developed by experience also,

85
00:15:55,672 --> 00:16:01,133
how you have been protected always; how you have been helped always; how you came out of so many crises.

86
00:16:01,142 --> 00:16:09,013
But despite that if you get upset, worried, if some clouds appear in the sky of your life,

87
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:16,223
then if you get upset, that means you are still weak. So first thing,

88
00:16:16,232 --> 00:16:21,790
if you are really worshipping the Goddess, then you should have no worry at all of any kind,

89
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:30,888
and you should have no fear at all. Go ahead, fearlessly. Whatever you are doing, do it fearlessly.

90
00:16:30,888 --> 00:16:36,216
 But at the same time I have to tell you the other side, that one should

91
00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:45,799
not go about like a zombie, it doesn't mean that; saying all kinds of nonsensical things of the right side.

92
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:55,679
But if you have to do something, do it with clear-cut ideas, and also without any fear.

93
00:16:56,312 --> 00:17:03,763
So all Her powers, you start manifesting it. A man who is fearless has nothing to worry about

94
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:13,953
- his sleep, his well-being, nothing. He is fearless. Again I say, "fearless" doesn't

95
00:17:13,962 --> 00:17:20,143
mean you go on hitting everybody, saying all kinds of things, no. It means that you are fearless:

96
00:17:20,152 --> 00:17:25,313
anybody who attacks you, you can always protect yourself. I mean, this story I told you,

97
00:17:25,322 --> 00:17:32,613
because this was not a protection which was from within, like Goddess protecting

98
00:17:32,622 --> 00:17:40,353
them, but actually protected himself. So the power had started working through him.

99
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:49,311
You should allow your mind, your body to project these powers. Otherwise we say here pujas, everything,

100
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:58,233
all right; and the power is there; but your mind which tells you "No, no, no, this is not so."

101
00:17:58,486 --> 00:18:06,296
 There's so many stories, so many miracles people have described about this.

102
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:13,552
So, first of all, you should not have any fear about anything. If you have done nothing wrong,

103
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:19,939
if you are on the right path, you will be always protected. Now remember this

104
00:18:20,022 --> 00:18:29,643
- you will be always protected. Remember this and believe in this, that: "I am always protected."

105
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:36,063
This is something very difficult, because perhaps our mind gives ideas: "Oh God,

106
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:42,443
what will happen now; what is going to happen?"... this thing, that thing.

107
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:51,173
So first and foremost thing, as I said, is to be fearless - to make the Goddess expres Herself.s

108
00:18:51,182 --> 00:18:59,993
Supposing now, take it like this: now all Ganas are following you. Now if the

109
00:19:00,002 --> 00:19:15,033
leader of an army is a frightened personality, what will others do? Thus, you become dependent

110
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:26,073
upon yourself. This faith also must be developed. I have seen people who are sick -

111
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:31,403
so they must come and see Me, because they do not depend upon themselves. They can cure themselves.

112
00:19:31,412 --> 00:19:37,003
There is no need for them to come and see Me. There are many cases where people have

113
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:45,303
cured themselves, cured others, just with prayer. But the faith, when it is not matured,

114
00:19:45,312 --> 00:19:51,673
then they think I, I should treat them. I should touch them, I should do this, I should do that.

115
00:19:51,682 --> 00:19:57,813
Now I have stopped it. I used to do once upon a time. Reason is, now you depend

116
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:03,893
upon yourself. Not only that you can help yourself, but you are going to help others.

117
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:11,063
But if you do not have faith in yourself, that you can cure, you can look after yourself,

118
00:20:11,072 --> 00:20:21,068
you can protect yourself; so the whole thing becomes like a ... all the time the Mother has to do the job.

119
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:28,453
Now you, first of all, you have to feed the little baby; all right? You can get him aid,

120
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:33,693
look after him, do everything. But when he grows up, then he doesn't want his mother to feed him.

121
00:20:33,702 --> 00:20:40,303
In the same way, the Sahaja Yogis now, how many years I have been working.

122
00:20:40,312 --> 00:20:53,603
You have to grow up dignified and you should mature, so that you can yourself do things properly.

123
00:20:53,612 --> 00:21:03,433
This maturity is there because your Mother has blessed you. All Her powers She has given you - every.

124
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:14,923
But one power, of patience, is difficult. You have to be patient like your Mother.

125
00:21:14,932 --> 00:21:21,663
You might think it's very difficult. But try to be. Must have patience, first of all,

126
00:21:21,672 --> 00:21:26,673
with yourself. I have known many people who think they are spiritually nothing and

127
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:36,323
they have not achieved anything. This is absolutely a sort of a escapicism, that you want to escape

128
00:21:36,332 --> 00:21:42,803
your personality. Just see. If you introspect, you will find out that you have developed

129
00:21:42,812 --> 00:21:50,723
into a real spiritual giant now. Nobody can touch you; you can do everything;

130
00:21:50,732 --> 00:21:59,513
you can look after yourself; you can support others. Whatever are the powers of all these that

131
00:21:59,522 --> 00:22:07,263
they were singing yesterday, all these powers are manifesting in you. But still you leave

132
00:22:07,272 --> 00:22:16,433
it to chance and, I should say, you leave it to others, not to yourself.

133
00:22:16,442 --> 00:22:27,103
Now this is one point that no one, so far, has done this kind of a job - is to connect

134
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:37,443
all the disciples to the Divine power. Because it is the Divine power of love, you must know

135
00:22:37,452 --> 00:22:41,143
how to love others. That's very important. But again, when it comes to love, they will

136
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:47,823
love their child, love their wife; I mean it is very common in Sahaja Yoga. They are

137
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:55,923
too attached to their children. Before this, they were known to be absolutely selfish,

138
00:22:55,932 --> 00:23:02,263
had no attachment for children or wife or anything. But now it is like a glue.

139
00:23:02,272 --> 00:23:10,423
Children are glued to them, wife is glued to them and the family - very important.

140
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:15,003
This is another temptation from which you have to get out.

141
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:18,059
I am not saying that you have to give up your family or your child.

142
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:25,114
But, again I say, the detachment. The detachment is your power.

143
00:23:26,702 --> 00:23:31,723
Watch everything with detachment. Now don't think that, "Oh, I came only a few days back

144
00:23:31,732 --> 00:23:38,883
in Sahaja Yoga"...no. Don't think, "Somebody is higher than me; I am no good" ... no.

145
00:23:38,892 --> 00:23:50,613
You just introspect yourself and see for yourself how many powers you have already got.

146
00:23:50,622 --> 00:23:58,193
And the more you'll know, the more you'll become humble. It's very surprising. You'll become humble.

147
00:23:58,202 --> 00:24:07,633
No fear of any kind. You can have fear if you have some, say, lot of money with you.

148
00:24:07,642 --> 00:24:14,663
If you are very well educated, you might have fear of jealousies. If you have other

149
00:24:14,672 --> 00:24:21,013
wealth like ornaments and things, you will be afraid of big thieves coming around.

150
00:24:21,022 --> 00:24:28,323
If you are a politician, you might be afraid that somebody might take away your seat when

151
00:24:28,332 --> 00:24:37,223
you are away. But, when it comes really to Sahaja Yoga, it's the other way round. Who

152
00:24:37,232 --> 00:24:51,423
can steal your Self-realization? Tell me! Who can steal your powers? Who can steal your

153
00:24:51,432 --> 00:25:04,063
vibrations? Think of it. And who can steal your love? Because it is coming from the Spirit,

154
00:25:04,072 --> 00:25:12,743
which is eternal, and the flow is all the time there. Only when you go away from your Spirit,

155
00:25:12,752 --> 00:25:27,673
then only you feel all these things, which one feels in the darkness.

156
00:25:27,682 --> 00:25:35,263
Then another power of Mother is that She gives you a state in which you are a sakshi,

157
00:25:35,272 --> 00:25:47,131
you are a witness, watching everything. You have tremendous patience; tremendous patience.

158
00:25:47,131 --> 00:25:52,763
Whatever's happened, all right, let it be. This will be all right, that will be all right, this and that.

159
00:25:52,763 --> 00:26:01,923
So you get rid of a horrible thing called anger. And this gives you such

160
00:26:01,923 --> 00:26:09,934
a peaceful witness state, that you start becoming younger and younger. I will tell you,

161
00:26:09,142 --> 00:26:15,513
some Sahaja Yogis whom I gave Realization, say, last year, this time I met them -

162
00:26:15,522 --> 00:26:22,373
I could not recognize. They have suddenly become ten years younger. It's very surprising.

163
00:26:22,382 --> 00:26:29,323
And I was Myself, had to confess that I really, I can't recognize that are you the same people,

164
00:26:29,332 --> 00:26:34,023
or are you the son of that fellow?

165
00:26:34,032 --> 00:26:45,483
So then, what happens to you is that you become a peaceful personality. Why? Because your

166
00:26:45,492 --> 00:26:53,703
Mother is there always. This faith: She is always there, She is always with us,

167
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:58,633
always protecting us: but now we are grown up, so She has given us all the powers. All the property

168
00:26:58,642 --> 00:27:08,943
She has given us; so what, what is there to be afraid of? But this faith has to be not

169
00:27:08,952 --> 00:27:16,733
just a blind faith, but an enlightened faith. Now the difference is, in blind faith you

170
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:26,554
have faith but no powers. In enlightened faith, you have faith and all the powers. When that happens to you,

171
00:27:26,554 --> 00:27:39,265
you start growing very much fast - first in your dharma. And you are not afraid of your virtues.

172
00:27:39,382 --> 00:27:50,003
You tell people, talk about Sahaja Yoga everywhere, and it works, it clicks. Once you don't have any fear,

173
00:27:50,012 --> 00:27:56,743
the whole picture will be clear to you, because you become a visionary:

174
00:27:56,752 --> 00:28:04,833
what we call in Sanskrit "drishtas". Like see how C. S. Lewis could see our procession.

175
00:28:04,842 --> 00:28:14,793
How could William Blake predict our future? How could Gyaneshwara, wrote about "Pasayadan",

176
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:19,243
which is a description of all the Sahaja Yogis? But all the time he is saying, "Now you get

177
00:28:19,252 --> 00:28:27,078
up and walk, and do this, you are that, now you've got it." He is trying to assure people all the time.

178
00:28:27,174 --> 00:28:34,877
How could Rabindranath Tagore see our going to Ganapatipule? How could it happen?

179
00:28:34,952 --> 00:28:48,763
It happens only when people are in enlightened faith. In enlightened faith your Mother gives

180
00:28:48,772 --> 00:28:57,383
you another very great power, is of discretion; of discretion. Somebody came to me,

181
00:28:57,392 --> 00:29:04,383
"Mother,You see, this gentleman is very good, this, that; and You know nobody has looked after

182
00:29:04,392 --> 00:29:09,133
him, this that... He is very well educated, very moneyed person...this, that." I said:

183
00:29:09,142 --> 00:29:15,973
"All right, show Me the photograph." I saw the photograph. I said: "No - yes,better keep him out.

184
00:29:15,982 --> 00:29:22,663
Absolutely. Keep him out!" He was amazed. "How You say keep him out absolutely?"

185
00:29:22,672 --> 00:29:28,983
I saw the photograph, and in the photograph only how could Mother say that? I could feel

186
00:29:28,992 --> 00:29:35,253
the vibrations. Immediately I said: "Is wrong."

187
00:29:35,262 --> 00:29:41,823
One gentleman came here and told Me that some Nigerians have written letter to him,

188
00:29:41,832 --> 00:29:50,393
that "You put thirty-five thousand pounds in the bank", or something like that, "and we'll

189
00:29:50,402 --> 00:29:57,793
put our money, quite a lot, in millions, and then you can have one third of that." He came

190
00:29:57,802 --> 00:30:07,643
and told Me this story. I said, "Really? Keep out of it." So he said, "Why?" " It's a scam."

191
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:15,043
When he went back to America, they found it was a scam. He said, "Mother, how did you know?"

192
00:30:15,052 --> 00:30:23,553
I said: "You can feel the vibrations - so hot! So it is a scam." You have got vibrations.

193
00:30:23,562 --> 00:30:32,186
You can feel your vibrations. Now if you don't want to use this new awareness, what is the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga?

194
00:30:32,186 --> 00:30:37,284
He was very upset when I told him, "Forget it." He thought: "Why Mother is saying so?"

195
00:30:37,372 --> 00:30:43,973
I said: "Now what do you need money for? You need money? All right. We have. Don't take

196
00:30:43,982 --> 00:30:50,493
these things." When I told him it's a scam, he got a shock. When he went back, he found

197
00:30:50,502 --> 00:30:58,473
out it was a scam. So at the airport only, he was on My feet prostrated. I said, "What
happened?"

198
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:05,503
"Mother, You are the limit. What You said is there." I said: "But it was the

199
00:31:05,512 --> 00:31:14,183
vibrations which told Me that he is a cheat. So, if he says so, that he is going to give

200
00:31:14,192 --> 00:31:23,253
you so much money, is not correct because his vibrations were so very bad." In this way,

201
00:31:23,262 --> 00:31:34,023
you can gradually experience. With the experience, try to put the experience in your

202
00:31:34,032 --> 00:31:44,273
heart and have faith in that experience. What were you? What have you become now?

203
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:54,933
How many experiences of Sahaja Yoga you had? - of the Mother's attention on you.

204
00:31:54,942 --> 00:32:01,365
Now if you have that enlightened faith, enlightened faith in you, you become powerful...

205
00:32:01,365 --> 00:32:06,285
You are powerless, because your faith is like this.

206
00:32:08,392 --> 00:32:20,173
But if you become really a evolved, matured realized soul, then all your powers will work.

207
00:32:20,182 --> 00:32:46,403
There's a fisherman in India, who is - I mean, he is a graduate though he is a fisherman.

208
00:32:46,412 --> 00:32:56,303
So one day, he was going on a boat to another island to do Sahaja Yoga. And when he came

209
00:32:56,312 --> 00:33:04,503
out of his hut, he found huge big clouds, black ones, hovering and the Vishnumaya playing.

210
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:11,803
Just he stood on the shore and told Vishnumaya, "Please tell these clouds to behave themselves.

211
00:33:11,812 --> 00:33:18,363
I am going for the work of Mother, and dare not trouble me on the way." Just told it.

212
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:22,793
The people who were with him, told me that this Harishchandra was talking like that.

213
00:33:22,802 --> 00:33:32,389
They got into the boat. They did the program, came home. When he went into his boat, the rain started.

214
00:33:32,572 --> 00:33:42,623
So you control all five elements by your enlightened faith. For which you don't even have to say

215
00:33:42,632 --> 00:33:50,523
anything. The powers are so great that they act. See now: today when the Puja was to be done,

216
00:33:50,532 --> 00:33:58,253
suddenly it became pleasant. I didn't ask. Just it became pleasant, much better

217
00:33:58,262 --> 00:34:08,423
than yesterday: could have been very cold. But this should become again, a faith which

218
00:34:08,432 --> 00:34:15,623
is reality. If you remember last time, we had a horrible rain and the whole thing was

219
00:34:15,632 --> 00:34:24,273
jumping up and people had to pull all these pillars down. As soon as they started saying

220
00:34:24,282 --> 00:34:31,973
My "Jai", it stopped. Now, this experience should make you; there was no need for you

221
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:40,543
to pull the ... these pillars, but you had to just sing My "Jai", that's all. Instead of that,

222
00:34:40,552 --> 00:34:44,563
you were busy with pulling all of you that thing. I was just looking at you,

223
00:34:44,572 --> 00:34:49,053
I didn't know what to say anything; I said, "Let them try."

224
00:34:49,062 --> 00:34:59,993
So these ordeals also come to make you mature. These ordeals if they are not there,

225
00:35:00,002 --> 00:35:07,313
These ordeals if they do not come, then you will not supersede them; and if you will not supersede them,

226
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:14,573
you will not know what is your faith. A person who is standing on the shore will say,

227
00:35:14,582 --> 00:35:21,363
"I don't know how to swim." But supposing you made him jump into the water and he swims,

228
00:35:21,372 --> 00:35:31,413
then he knows that he can swim. Because you do not know what you have become.

229
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:37,503
You do not know that you can swim. You do not know that you can also save others.

230
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:46,229
 You are still busy with small, small, little, little things here and there. But if you just know what you have become,

231
00:35:46,229 --> 00:36:02,954
then you are going to completely change. Your smallness, which looks like a little particle,

232
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:12,234
will cover the whole sky. But this power that is within you, will not give you ego.

233
00:36:12,234 --> 00:36:20,248
One thing, the test is, it makes you humble. This is one of the things: that it makes you humble,

234
00:36:20,248 --> 00:36:24,919
and extremely loving and compassionate. You will not hurt other people

235
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:32,655
with these powers; that's the sign: it is Mother's love, power of Mother's love.

236
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:41,823
A person who has a mother, very loving and nice, it's a psychological fact, becomes a very nice person;

237
00:36:42,022 --> 00:36:45,578
 it's a psychological fact.

238
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:53,703
So now if you realize what you are now, what you have become. Navaratri Puja is,

239
00:36:54,102 --> 00:37:03,513
that's why, is a very, very powerful Puja in a way: because it manifests, opens out the channels

240
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:15,863
of your power, that's why it's very, very important; and since morning I have been just

241
00:37:15,872 --> 00:37:23,293
flowing with vibrations, tremendous, it was like a waterfall of vibrations. And the whole

242
00:37:23,302 --> 00:37:26,383
time I am seeing light, light, light, light; I was thinking, "Now I don't know what am

243
00:37:26,392 --> 00:37:33,133
I going to speak or something." That's why I closed My eyes, because all the time there

244
00:37:33,142 --> 00:37:37,203
will be something else I will be seeing and not you people; so better, I thought,

245
00:37:37,212 --> 00:37:48,843
I'll close My eyes. But now you are the light. You are the light. Light is not afraid of

246
00:37:48,852 --> 00:37:56,613
darkness, is it? Because, it can remove the darkness. That's what you are, but you don't

247
00:37:56,622 --> 00:38:03,533
know what you are, and you live with very small, very small ideas about yourself.

248
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:14,083
I am not saying that you should become like gurus that go round talking big, with two

249
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:23,763
horns on their head, no. What is your decoration is your humility, is your kindness, is your sweetness,

250
00:38:23,772 --> 00:38:29,843
and the way you handle people. You will be amazed, I also tell people when

251
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:37,523
I find there is something wrong with them. I also do it, no doubt; but in a way that

252
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:44,473
the person understands it is for the benevolence of that person. So the whole personality,

253
00:38:44,482 --> 00:38:58,963
the whole temperament, everything changes; the whole face changes; the whole movement

254
00:38:58,972 --> 00:39:08,803
changes. The style of talking changes, automatically as if you know the machinery has changed,

255
00:39:08,812 --> 00:39:20,803
within. So you develop the qualities of a real Mahayogi.

256
00:39:20,812 --> 00:39:34,923
This Mahayogi condition is achieved by many people also before, but they had to go through

257
00:39:34,932 --> 00:39:43,513
very circuitous life. They had to give up everything, not to show, but really from the

258
00:39:43,522 --> 00:39:50,673
heart they had to detach. They had to get out of it, go to some far-fetched places,

259
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:55,183
and live on ordinary food. All kinds of . . .even Buddha suffered so much. Christ suffered so much.

260
00:39:55,192 --> 00:40:06,123
They were Incarnations but still they had to suffer. Rama suffered so much;

261
00:40:06,132 --> 00:40:11,463
Shri Krishna suffered so much: imagine. Now you people didn't have to suffer. On the contrary

262
00:40:11,472 --> 00:40:28,153
you all came out of the suffering: enjoyment, music, everything. But to enjoy Sahaja Yoga,

263
00:40:28,162 --> 00:40:39,563
in Niranand - absolutely without anything else but joy - then one has to know that he

264
00:40:39,572 --> 00:40:46,823
should give up all the myths with which he is living. All kinds of myths there are.

265
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:51,963
Some people have myths: "We are very poor". Some have myths: "We are very rich".

266
00:40:51,972 --> 00:40:58,153
Some have this thing that "We are very unhappy". Some have that "We are very happy".

267
00:40:58,162 --> 00:41:10,243
All kinds of myths these are. These are all myths. What is the thing is the complete emptiness; complete emptiness.

268
00:41:10,252 --> 00:41:18,883
That is joy. This emptiness is filled with joy. Complete emptiness.

269
00:41:18,892 --> 00:41:26,343
Then you don't expect anything from anyone. And this emptiness from within is actually, gives

270
00:41:26,352 --> 00:41:34,033
chance to compassion and love to enter into you. Supposing there is something in a pot

271
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:42,043
already, what can you pour into it? What can you give into it? So if you are completely

272
00:41:42,052 --> 00:41:48,593
empty within, there's nothing of this nonsense of the past and the future: the aspirations,

273
00:41:48,602 --> 00:41:56,773
the ambitions, all those things, and falsehood. If you just become empty, it is filled in

274
00:41:56,782 --> 00:42:05,163
with nothing but joy, and joy of such a eternal nature. You never asked for it; you do not

275
00:42:05,172 --> 00:42:15,328
look forward to it. It is there, all the time. And this is what I wish today you people can feel it.

276
00:42:15,537 --> 00:42:24,382
As you know, the Devi's things are so very deep and subtle: how She took the form of

277
00:42:24,502 --> 00:42:37,663
a Mother and how She looked after Her bhaktas with love; how She fought demons and also negativity.

278
00:42:37,672 --> 00:42:45,793
But now the demons have entered into your hearts; these false gurus have entered

279
00:42:45,802 --> 00:42:52,763
into your brains. Through these horrible books so many things are coming, all the time attacking you.

280
00:42:52,772 --> 00:43:01,953
Even if you kill those demons, still they'll be lingering in your heads. They should

281
00:43:01,962 --> 00:43:09,863
be actually killed when they, once they are reflected into your mind, have gone away.

282
00:43:09,872 --> 00:43:15,563
Then only it's possible to eliminate them. Otherwise, they will go away but leave their

283
00:43:15,572 --> 00:43:24,563
bhoots into your heads. So these negativities, which come from wrong type of following you

284
00:43:24,572 --> 00:43:30,643
have had, from wrong books you have been reading, also in Sahaja Yoga when you come, you can

285
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:37,648
be misled by some people - it's possible. In that case also, forgive that person. That person may improve,

286
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:44,438
but you may continue with the same ideas and funny things and will suddenly come up.

287
00:43:47,582 --> 00:44:02,153
So the quality is of compassion and love, fearlessness and courage and the complete emptiness.

288
00:44:02,162 --> 00:44:09,363
In this emptiness, then, you are not worried about what you have to achieve,

289
00:44:09,372 --> 00:44:16,799
how many people you have to gather, how many must come to Sahaja Yoga - not bothered about that.

290
00:44:16,799 --> 00:44:23,542
Automatically it will work out, but you would not desire for it, and you will not hanker:

291
00:44:23,542 --> 00:44:27,998
 "Oh my God," say, "There is not many people, what to do?"... this, that.

292
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:33,054
It is good for us in a way, because where is the place in heaven for so many stupid people?

293
00:44:33,232 --> 00:44:45,143
So we should not run after people who are negative and useless. But we must definitely

294
00:44:45,152 --> 00:44:53,903
take over the people who are genuinely good. One thing more I would like to tell you, that

295
00:44:53,912 --> 00:45:01,083
automatically such people are dropped out in Sahaja Yoga. In one shot they will go away.

296
00:45:01,092 --> 00:45:05,793
They don't stay, because they don't deserve to be there. They don't deserve to have the

297
00:45:05,802 --> 00:45:14,353
Mother's powers. So this happens in a very beautiful, subtle manner. And I see,

298
00:45:14,362 --> 00:45:25,100
I go late always to any program, so those who are useless just disappear. And some of them disappear half -way through,

299
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,771
because nothing goes into their head, really, they don't understand anything,

300
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:35,482
so they go away. So now the ones which are left are the real seekers of truth

301
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:42,466
and they get, all of them, Realization. In Sanskrit they call it "cheyen" - means "selection".

302
00:45:42,466 --> 00:45:51,882
This is a natural selection that takes place, and how people go away and how they come back to Sahaja Yoga,

303
00:45:51,882 --> 00:46:00,630
it's very interesting. This is a common happening in Sahaja Yoga, you know.

304
00:46:00,712 --> 00:46:06,193
You should not get upset. Now if you get too many people, say from Russia,

305
00:46:06,202 --> 00:46:13,843
and not so much from Switzerland, maybe you might think that way; but now it's not that bad.

306
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:23,233
Then we should not worry, because we are no more Russians or Swiss. We are superhuman beings,

307
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:30,003
we are Sahaja Yogis. Whether they are Russians or whether they are Indians or

308
00:46:30,012 --> 00:46:38,103
from some African land, it's all right. As long as they are Sahaja Yogis, we should be

309
00:46:38,112 --> 00:46:44,403
happy. If the Swiss are coming to Sahaja Yoga, we should be happy. So this attachment,

310
00:46:44,412 --> 00:46:49,423
in a way, is good to begin with, that you want to bring more Swiss, because you want to have company.

311
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:56,993
Now you can't live with one person in a jungle, with all the others non-Sahaja Yogis,

312
00:46:57,002 --> 00:47:01,583
you see - difficult. So you want to have company. So you want to have more and

313
00:47:01,592 --> 00:47:07,396
more and more. But doesn't matter. As many as there are sufficient,

314
00:47:07,396 --> 00:47:11,333
and we shouldn't worry about those things, the number.

315
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:18,060
But when we want to share our love, then we do feel the dearth. Not because we are Swiss,

316
00:47:18,342 --> 00:47:27,263
but because we cannot share. That time a new personality rises, and this new personality

317
00:47:27,272 --> 00:47:35,753
is the one which works. I mean we are not giving you any money; there are no awards for you.

318
00:47:35,762 --> 00:47:42,343
There's no way there's much encouragement, like we have your sort of a picture hanging here,

319
00:47:42,352 --> 00:47:48,013
nothing of the kind. Can you imagine in any organization anybody would work like this,

320
00:47:48,022 --> 00:47:54,833
the way you work? Nobody would. They give you awards, they give you bonuses,

321
00:47:54,842 --> 00:48:02,143
also they give you promotions; they do all kinds of things, you see, to keep you going.

322
00:48:02,152 --> 00:48:08,803
But we don't do anything in Sahaja Yoga. So what makes you work so hard in Sahaja Yoga,

323
00:48:08,812 --> 00:48:16,573
what makes you spread Sahaja Yoga? Only thing is that you want to share. You can't help it,

324
00:48:16,582 --> 00:48:21,703
it's like a drunkard you see. If he has a bottle, he must have at least one person to

325
00:48:21,712 --> 00:48:32,923
share with him, because he thinks that it would be sinful: "As it is I am doing sin,

326
00:48:32,932 --> 00:48:51,423
why not share with somebody else?" So it would be half-half divided. But in Sahaja Yoga you share it;

327
00:48:51,432 --> 00:49:01,903
you want to spread it. It is because you are collective; you have become collective,

328
00:49:01,912 --> 00:49:09,913
that's why. You want more to come in, more to join, to enjoy. You become a very noble

329
00:49:09,922 --> 00:49:15,533
person, you see? Like, of course drunkards do that, but supposing somebody has a lottery,

330
00:49:15,542 --> 00:49:23,763
or some, he gets a very big business, he won't like to share. But you think that "Why not?

331
00:49:23,772 --> 00:49:33,453
If I am so much enjoying, why not others? Why not people have the same bliss as I have?"

332
00:49:33,462 --> 00:49:42,233
So because you become extremely noble, so noble, you work so hard, so very hard to achieve it.

333
00:49:42,242 --> 00:49:50,183
 I mean, no words can describe My joy when I see you people working it so spontaneously.

334
00:49:50,192 --> 00:50:01,803
Yesterday I saw the film, the whole drama, and I was really very much amazed and touched

335
00:50:01,812 --> 00:50:14,193
that this Marathi music has come to Cabella. Can you imagine any Italian thinking of it?

336
00:50:14,202 --> 00:50:21,943
Even hundred years to come he would not think. But how it has come so spontaneously and is

337
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:28,273
working out? Because there is a sense of collectivity.

338
00:50:28,282 --> 00:50:35,473
The "New Age" people talk of is here, no doubt. This is the New Age, and new consciousness

339
00:50:35,482 --> 00:50:42,233
is also there. But what is the "new" now is the new collectivity, and that collectivity acts,

340
00:50:42,242 --> 00:50:51,253
that you want to spread: it acts, like your hunger, it is another kind of hunger,

341
00:50:51,262 --> 00:50:56,973
that you want to create more Sahaja Yogis, you want to have more brothers and sisters,

342
00:50:56,982 --> 00:51:02,123
and you want to help them so that they could come to the Pujas and all that and become

343
00:51:02,132 --> 00:51:09,783
good Sahaja Yogis. Now this kind of an ambition or a joy or whatever you may call it,

344
00:51:09,792 --> 00:51:17,883
is the whole plan, shows that in your heart, the collectivity is prospering. And that's why

345
00:51:17,892 --> 00:51:25,533
you cannot enjoy Sahaja Yoga alone, sitting in the Himalayas -no. You want to have other people.

346
00:51:25,992 --> 00:51:33,603
This is now the sign of how the Mother's love has taken roots in your hearts and how you

347
00:51:33,612 --> 00:51:42,383
are all going to spread Sahaja Yoga. Of course I'm told that somebody in Australia making money

348
00:51:42,392 --> 00:51:48,513
 - Australia has been always a problem - they are making money out of this;

349
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:54,323
so I just don't know what to say, because this is, I can't understand. How can they think

350
00:51:54,332 --> 00:52:05,543
of making money or doing all kinds of things, and doing all kinds of asahaj things?

351
00:52:05,552 --> 00:52:13,573
Some sort of a headache comes up, doesn't matter. Leave it to Me. I'll manage it, whatever it is;

352
00:52:13,582 --> 00:52:20,593
but you just become great lights of your Mother. That's what I have to request you tonight.

353
00:52:20,602 --> 00:52:30,423
You have all the power flowing in you, you have the light which is enlightened,

354
00:52:30,432 --> 00:52:38,193
but you must expand. Expand it more and more and more, and you will be surprised what Tukarama

355
00:52:38,202 --> 00:52:44,901
has said, that, "I am like a small little particle of dust, and also

356
00:52:44,901 --> 00:52:54,629
I am the whole sky." This is what is your personality.

357
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:59,688
May God bless you all.
