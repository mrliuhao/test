1
00:00:03,479 --> 00:00:05,960
Navaratri Puja.

2
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:09,657
Cabella ligure (Italy), 20 October 1996.

3
00:00:09,657 --> 00:00:17,428
Today is a special day, as you know we are worshipping the Goddess,

4
00:00:17,437 --> 00:00:37,948
who came on this earth nine times before, to kill all the demons and all the negativity and relieve all the bhaktas to worship.

5
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:44,978
All her work has already been described.

6
00:00:44,987 --> 00:01:03,988
Despite that they find, new type of devils, new type of negative people, have come back.

7
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:20,708
Perhaps it had to be.

8
00:01:20,717 --> 00:01:37,608
This had to be maybe, after all it is Kali Yuga and the drama of Kali Yuga would not be performed unless and until they are there.

9
00:01:37,617 --> 00:01:58,378
So to complete this drama, they came. But this time is going to be a very different type of war.

10
00:01:58,387 --> 00:02:20,488
It¡äs going to be the war of the peaceful people and the peaceful people are the most successful people in every walk of life, even in a war.

11
00:02:20,497 --> 00:02:24,518
It did not work out before.

12
00:02:24,527 --> 00:02:38,578
They say that when Genghis Khan came, he went to a very big monastery of Buddhist, near Gaya,

13
00:02:38,587 --> 00:02:51,778
and killed all of them, there were about 30,000 of Buddhists there, and they didn¡ät say a word and they were all killed.

14
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:56,608
So people started disbelieving in Buddhism.

15
00:02:56,617 --> 00:03:02,938
They said ¡°What kind of a Buddhism is here, why didn¡ät Buddha save them.

16
00:03:02,947 --> 00:03:07,428
That¡äs human style of thinking.

17
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:22,148
Buddha should have saved these 30,000 people who were peaceful, who were resisting, in a manner that was no resistance,

18
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:28,298
and so they were all killed by this horrible fellow called Genghis Khan.

19
00:03:28,307 --> 00:03:35,958
But you will be surprised in this Kali Yuga, this Genghis Khan has been praised by many authors,

20
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:39,268
and there are books written about him.

21
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:44,858
He was not a Moslem, but some sort of a crackpot.

22
00:03:44,867 --> 00:04:04,538
He finished off many mosques, he destroyed many beautiful buildings and also he came to India and ruled there for a short time.

23
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:08,128
All that¡äs a history.

24
00:04:08,137 --> 00:04:33,558
In the same way there have been wars between Christians and Non-Christians, between Moslems and Non-Moslems.

25
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:47,568
All kinds of wars we have heard of where only the faithful got lost - the real people got lost,

26
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:57,578
the one who worshipped God with full faith, got lost.

27
00:04:57,587 --> 00:05:04,728
So many people became atheists and they said there is nothing like God,

28
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:14,478
nothing like his Divine power, it never existed, we were stupid, we were foolish, to follow all this.

29
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:26,238
And those who were in charge of religion took full advantage of that and said that these people were sinful people,

30
00:05:26,247 --> 00:05:39,578
these people were not Godly people and that¡äs how they were killed by us and we were victorious.

31
00:05:39,587 --> 00:05:53,578
The idea of victory they had, that they have been successful and so many people have been butchered by us.

32
00:05:53,587 --> 00:06:07,848
So we come to Kali Yuga, and in Kali Yuga the same thing has started, in a subtler way, in a different way,

33
00:06:07,857 --> 00:06:26,418
it has started that there¡äs a big war going on between the people who are anti-God and who are using God for their own purpose.

34
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:37,908
Very dishonest, very corrupt, very cruel people and they are using the flag of God,

35
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:44,518
that banner which they have no right to use.

36
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:56,978
Then there are Sahaja Yogis, who have got their realization and they have to fight them.

37
00:06:56,987 --> 00:07:08,068
Now the difference in the previous wars and this war is very different.

38
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:17,378
In those wars, you see all those who were supposed to be victorious -

39
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:33,938
this was after all the nine battles of the Divine Mother - the negativity that came up and which became successful,

40
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:43,738
started feeling very confident that we have achieved what we wanted.

41
00:07:43,747 --> 00:08:11,498
But in Kali Yuga, in the light of Kali Yuga, all those historical victories are regarded as shameful things, as something very aggressive and non-sensical.

42
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:15,528
This is now being described everywhere.

43
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:27,038
Like the white skinned people went to America and killed all the rest of them there.

44
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:33,458
Now, that is coming into light.

45
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:45,338
All these people who thought themselves to be victorious - their children, their grandchildren, their progeny -

46
00:08:45,347 --> 00:08:56,798
are ashamed of them, ashamed to call that they were their forefathers, up till the last war.

47
00:08:56,807 --> 00:09:11,138
This awareness, which has come, is the real victory of modern times, of this Kali Yuga.

48
00:09:11,147 --> 00:09:23,578
That everything that was accepted as a part of the game, as the lifestyle, you can call it,

49
00:09:23,587 --> 00:09:29,198
is now being challenged in modern times everywhere.

50
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:47,848
Whatever is aggression, whatever is oppression, whatever is cruel, is now punished also.

51
00:09:47,857 --> 00:09:57,018
You see so many war criminals might have escaped but so many went into trials,

52
00:09:57,027 --> 00:10:02,878
it never happened before, nobody took Genghis Khan to a trial.

53
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:22,108
Now in a very subtle way, all these aggressive people are getting now afraid that they will be questioned and they maybe tortured.

54
00:10:22,117 --> 00:10:27,978
It started, I don¡ät know where, but definitely at the beginning of the Kali Yuga.

55
00:10:27,987 --> 00:10:34,698
If you remember in this country there was a great aggressive man called Mussolini,

56
00:10:34,707 --> 00:10:39,058
and ultimately he was hanged.

57
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:45,258
In Germany there was a very powerful man called Hitler and Himler and all this.

58
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:51,428
God knows what happened to them, even the Germans don¡ät want to take his name,

59
00:10:51,437 --> 00:10:54,668
they are all ashamed of him.

60
00:10:54,677 --> 00:11:04,088
Then we had somebody, say in England, Warren Hastings, who came to India, he was put to jail.

61
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:08,348
This was never done before.

62
00:11:08,357 --> 00:11:22,308
If Napoleon aggressed people, he thought he was very victorious, but he could not continue with it, he had to face it.

63
00:11:22,317 --> 00:11:32,918
You see anybody, who has been aggressive, who has been dominating,

64
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:45,518
who has been very cruel, demonic, has been taken to task, mostly in his lifetime.

65
00:11:45,527 --> 00:12:01,028
Now, if not in his lifetime, afterwards, he was maligned, and he doesn¡ät have a name like ¡°a hero¡± or anything,

66
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:06,268
people don¡ät want to erect their statues.

67
00:12:06,277 --> 00:12:15,608
So the awareness has come in the mind of the people. Like a person like Stalin, who ruled Russia once upon a time,

68
00:12:15,617 --> 00:12:24,208
today you can¡ät see even one statue of Stalin, these are modern times.

69
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:36,238
See the power of modern times, and that is frightening to those people who think they can get along with whatever they are doing.

70
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:50,418
It is going to be very soon understood by them, that they have to stop all this nonsense, otherwise they will suffer.

71
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:57,898
It¡äs not those whom they are dominating but those who are dominating, who will suffer.

72
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:10,648
They will suffer physically, they will suffer mentally, they will suffer emotionally, and also their fame will be in the mud.

73
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:25,631
So today¡äs victory of the power of the Divine Mother, is doing one very great work - is to expose,

74
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:37,327
and this exposure will be condemning publicly those people who are doing wrong.

75
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:48,658
If you see from that point of view you will understand how we are victorious now.

76
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:53,108
Many of you felt very sad that I didn¡ät get the award.

77
00:13:53,117 --> 00:13:58,908
This award makes no difference to me and to you also, I must tell you.

78
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:07,828
Because you have come without me having any award, and many will come without having any award as such.

79
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:17,978
But, this time, for the first time, if you notice, the people who got the award are condemned.

80
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:24,488
Even now they are writing against it, even now they are criticizing.

81
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:34,338
So those who have been, they thought they were very smart, but the smartness is out now and I don¡ät know how long will it go on.

82
00:14:34,347 --> 00:14:39,298
Because even today if you open a newspaper, you will find something about it,

83
00:14:39,307 --> 00:14:46,608
that how stupidly they have done it, they can¡ät understand what was the reason they have done it.

84
00:14:46,617 --> 00:14:56,258
Not only the people who selected are criticized, but very much more the people who are selected.

85
00:14:56,267 --> 00:15:14,158
Now, as being Sahaja Yogis, we have to know what is the difference between the consciousness at that time and awareness at this time.

86
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:25,738
That time it was necessary to kill those demons - finish them, but they are back again on the stage.

87
00:15:25,747 --> 00:15:38,608
Now, at this time, when it is Kali Yuga, they are exposed, they are condemned,

88
00:15:38,617 --> 00:15:45,338
they are put in the jail and they are now punished publicly.

89
00:15:45,347 --> 00:15:58,258
So the collective awareness has got such a great victory, I think, over these people whom so many came,

90
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:07,668
killed and died without getting any punishment out of it, without getting any defamation out of it.

91
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:26,218
Now let us see what is consciousness and what is awareness.

92
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:33,528
It is a subtle subject, which I think you all can understand.

93
00:16:33,537 --> 00:16:40,818
Conscious is that, when you are made conscious, you become conscious about it.

94
00:16:40,827 --> 00:16:53,268
Like I have my hand here, alright, but normally I am not conscious of it, that I have a hand.

95
00:16:53,277 --> 00:16:58,478
If a man is sleeping, he¡äs not conscious that he is sleeping.

96
00:16:58,487 --> 00:17:05,698
When you tell me you have a hand, I become conscious, or something pricks me,

97
00:17:05,707 --> 00:17:14,438
then I become conscious. Otherwise I am unconscious about it.

98
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:26,858
I¡äm absolutely unconscious about my eyes, I¡äm seeing everything. But supposing I become blind,

99
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:39,638
I can¡ät see, then I become conscious of my eyes that I¡äve got, my eyes through which now I cannot see.

100
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:47,488
So once you say there is this hand, the consciousness is there.

101
00:17:47,497 --> 00:17:55,988
This we can say, is the knowledge about the hand, that you get knowledge about the hand.

102
00:17:55,997 --> 00:18:06,588
But once you are not conscious of the hand, that knowledge has disappeared.

103
00:18:06,597 --> 00:18:16,058
So, to say there is ignorance or there is knowledge, both things are just the same.

104
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:24,498
You are not conscious of your hand, so you are quite ignorant about it.

105
00:18:24,507 --> 00:18:33,898
Now supposing somebody says ¡°your hands are very beautiful¡±, somebody remarks like that,

106
00:18:33,907 --> 00:18:44,688
then I become conscious of my hand, which is beautiful, otherwise I never knew they were beautiful.

107
00:18:44,697 --> 00:18:53,218
So, normally all human beings live at that level - that somebody has to tell you.

108
00:18:53,227 --> 00:18:57,698
Now, somebody said ¡°you are wearing a very nice sari¡±, alright.

109
00:18:57,707 --> 00:19:05,578
Then I look at it, ¡°yes, it¡äs very nice, I never knew¡±.

110
00:19:05,587 --> 00:19:16,788
So, somebody has to tell you, then you become conscious, otherwise you are not.

111
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:22,908
So, we all human beings, at that level, are like that.

112
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:30,908
Now, what is awareness? That¡äs a different thing.

113
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:40,998
That means, if I see somebody is attacking me, I put my hand - like this,

114
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:49,628
that means I am aware that I have a hand - I¡äm not conscious but I am aware that I have a hand, I have to use it.

115
00:19:49,637 --> 00:19:56,618
Like here in Italy you go on using your hands all the time, like this.

116
00:19:56,627 --> 00:20:09,868
That means you know, you are aware, that you have got hands, that you have to use them for expressing something more, sort of emphatically.

117
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:24,998
So we are sort of also aware of our body, we are aware of others, we know about others,

118
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:35,798
we know what sort of a person another one is - up till you are self realized.

119
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:43,748
After self realization, what happens? It is very interesting.

120
00:20:43,757 --> 00:20:55,738
After self realization you go beyond both these things. Consciousness and awareness.

121
00:20:55,747 --> 00:21:03,078
Because you go beyond thought.

122
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:14,778
You have gone beyond thought, means what? - anger, all kinds of ideas, all kinds of aggression,

123
00:21:14,787 --> 00:21:25,148
everything is maneuvered or worked through your mind.

124
00:21:25,157 --> 00:21:41,218
So if your mind is lost, what will you do?  There¡äs no mind anymore. You exist with reality.

125
00:21:41,227 --> 00:21:51,478
So there is no mind to communicate - we call it thoughtlessly aware - means what?.

126
00:21:51,487 --> 00:21:58,818
We have conquered all our enemies by giving up one enemy, that was our mind.

127
00:21:58,827 --> 00:22:05,848
There¡äs no mind to suggest, there¡äs no mind to tell you.

128
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:11,888
So once there is no mind, you are lost (dissolved into the ocean - into thoughtlessness).

129
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:19,138
Now, it is being said that you ask a question to yourself ¡°who am I¡±.

130
00:22:19,147 --> 00:22:30,168
As soon as you ask this question you become thoughtless, so you get lost, you cannot answer this question.

131
00:22:30,177 --> 00:22:43,948
Otherwise you might say, I am a woman, I am this, I am that, I am a bishop or I am a pope, I am this, I am that.

132
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:48,848
But once you are a realized soul, who will tell you who you are,

133
00:22:48,857 --> 00:22:56,768
because the one which tells you is the mind, which doesn¡ät exist, no thought.

134
00:22:56,777 --> 00:23:09,728
Means you get just dissolved into yourself. This is what is reality.

135
00:23:09,737 --> 00:23:19,868
But you are aware also. Now, that¡äs another point.

136
00:23:19,877 --> 00:23:28,718
If you ask yourself a question, you are not there, but you are aware.

137
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:35,808
If your nabhi is catching, immediately you know my nabhi is catching, I have got liver.

138
00:23:35,817 --> 00:23:37,528
You don¡ät have to ask questions.

139
00:23:37,537 --> 00:23:47,728
Or somebody is standing near you, left swadisthana, oh my God, it is this one.

140
00:23:47,737 --> 00:23:52,768
If somebody is very angry and hot tempered, immediately you¡¯ll feel such heat from that person

141
00:23:52,777 --> 00:23:57,028
- oh God, I¡äll run away from this man.

142
00:23:57,037 --> 00:24:12,448
So this is a new realm you have entered into - reality, which you were never aware of before.

143
00:24:12,457 --> 00:24:23,948
Now, supposing there¡äs a very bad man standing near you. He might be a thief, he might be a murderer, anything.

144
00:24:23,957 --> 00:24:30,898
You will not be even conscious of it, leave alone aware, normally.

145
00:24:30,907 --> 00:24:45,608
But once you are a realized soul, you become aware of the whole - that is reality.

146
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:56,208
What are the problems in the collective, you become aware of the collective.

147
00:24:56,217 --> 00:24:59,518
You become aware of the problems of the whole world.

148
00:24:59,527 --> 00:25:09,088
Now this awareness is very different. The first awareness, as I told you, is like this.

149
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:19,238
That if somebody tells you that you are this and this, you become aware of it.

150
00:25:19,247 --> 00:25:37,368
In this nobody has to tell you, it¡äs just there. You are there, you know what it is.

151
00:25:37,377 --> 00:25:46,088
And this is what you have achieved, in these modern times.

152
00:25:46,097 --> 00:25:56,318
Which is the blessing of the modern times also, that we know now who we are.

153
00:25:56,327 --> 00:26:04,008
You always say, we are the pure spirit, yesterday also I heard it. Are you sure?

154
00:26:04,017 --> 00:26:13,868
What makes you believe that? That you are the pure spirit.

155
00:26:13,877 --> 00:26:21,948
I mean you haven¡ät seen your spirit, have you? You haven¡ät seen yourself, what you are.

156
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:34,358
Then, how do you say that you are the pure spirit? It¡äs just you¡äre saying something, because I say so.

157
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:43,378
But you are the pure spirit, because whatever is the description of the pure spirit is given

158
00:26:43,387 --> 00:26:55,698
- that it is aware of the Divine Power.

159
00:26:55,707 --> 00:27:04,688
It is aware of the Divine Power and that is how you are the pure spirit.

160
00:27:04,697 --> 00:27:19,968
Because only through pure spirit, as your personality, you can be aware of this all-pervading power.

161
00:27:19,977 --> 00:27:27,878
This is written in all the shastras, in all the scriptures, everywhere.

162
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:40,368
And what do you know about yourself, that you are the spirit. Because you know about your own chakras.

163
00:27:40,377 --> 00:27:44,318
You know about your own nadis.

164
00:27:44,327 --> 00:27:55,268
Now, what has happened is that you are separated from yourself and you can see yourself.

165
00:27:55,277 --> 00:28:12,288
You see yourself very clearly and you start seeing yourself as the present and the past and the future.

166
00:28:12,297 --> 00:28:18,928
In the past, what I was, you see you are shocked, oh, my goodness, I was like this.

167
00:28:18,937 --> 00:28:27,178
You see it, through this present state, in the present state you see.

168
00:28:27,187 --> 00:28:37,348
Then you start forgetting it, forget the past, forget the past.

169
00:28:37,357 --> 00:28:47,728
Then still you have the future, then you start thinking about the future.

170
00:28:47,737 --> 00:28:54,478
First future they think about their own children, their wives - Sahaja Yogis also.

171
00:28:54,487 --> 00:29:02,348
What will happen to my children, what will happen to my wife?

172
00:29:02,357 --> 00:29:14,038
Then they think, what will happen to Sahaja Yoga? Then they think what will happen to Mataji?

173
00:29:14,047 --> 00:29:28,738
Also they think, what will happen to this world? Because your awareness has expanded.

174
00:29:28,747 --> 00:29:35,118
You are not in the limited sphere now, anymore.

175
00:29:35,127 --> 00:29:49,598
You can think of your children, you can think of your wife, also you can think of the whole world and all the problems of the world you think.

176
00:29:49,607 --> 00:29:58,098
So you have reached that state, alright - up to that state we are.

177
00:29:58,107 --> 00:30:13,468
Now what is the thing that covers up all this, or gives you solutions, say for your children, for your family, your wife, everyone

178
00:30:13,477 --> 00:30:23,898
- what is the solution? Your Mother believes in giving the solutions, not only the problems.

179
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:35,798
Because, these days, there are not problems that existed in the Navaratri, they no more exist -

180
00:30:35,807 --> 00:30:51,028
that you can take a sword in your hand and go and kill somebody - no, it doesn¡ät, it is not possible.

181
00:30:51,037 --> 00:31:01,998
So, today¡¯s problems as they are, as we see, within us, we see the problems,

182
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:07,698
we are aware of it and we want to do something about it.

183
00:31:07,707 --> 00:31:17,948
Whether we are in the past, present or future, we see the problem.

184
00:31:17,957 --> 00:31:32,588
So now, what is the solution?  We have no weapons, nothing to fight.

185
00:31:32,597 --> 00:31:39,258
We don¡ät know also, so many do not even know how to hold a sword in the hand.

186
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:46,808
And so many don¡ät even want to hold it because they are so much in compassion,

187
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:51,618
in the ocean of compassion enjoying themselves nicely.

188
00:31:51,627 --> 00:31:58,538
They are enjoying their own compassion and the compassion of others, compassion of their Mother.

189
00:31:58,547 --> 00:32:18,988
But then how to solve the problem?  The problem can be solved if you become really powerful yourself within.

190
00:32:18,997 --> 00:32:37,588
Where is your attention? You have to move inward. Where is your attention? You have to become very powerful.

191
00:32:37,597 --> 00:32:46,108
I have done my job, I have given you realization, you have grown so much.

192
00:32:46,117 --> 00:32:50,628
I have explained to you, I have told you everything this time.

193
00:32:50,637 --> 00:33:01,658
I have given you lots of love, ocean of love I should say, as you call it, whatever it is.

194
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:12,268
But now you have to nourish yourself, you have to become powerful within yourself.

195
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:18,398
So what is the way you can become powerful?

196
00:33:21,838 --> 00:33:37,526
First you must believe that you have transcended your human personality and you have now become a super human being.

197
00:33:41,277 --> 00:33:49,958
First of all this must come, this is what we call as faith.

198
00:33:49,967 --> 00:34:02,958
This faith is not false faith, it is not blind faith that you believe into something, but it is a fact.

199
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:11,148
I have, a hundred times, I have told you, that you have to have first of all faith in your ascent,

200
00:34:11,157 --> 00:34:17,958
in your position as Sahaja Yogis.

201
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:25,298
For this, meditation is very important, very important.

202
00:34:25,307 --> 00:34:31,948
Without meditation you cannot have full faith in yourself.

203
00:34:31,957 --> 00:34:40,498
Because you can¡ät know yourself, by saying ¡°who am I¡±? You cannot.

204
00:34:40,507 --> 00:34:54,168
You try now asking the question - who am I? you¡äll be lost.

205
00:34:54,177 --> 00:35:07,858
So what should be the faith then, because when you ask this question ¡°who am I?¡±, you are lost.

206
00:35:07,867 --> 00:35:16,878
So, you reach a stage where I have to tell you that faith is not mental, it is not emotional,

207
00:35:16,887 --> 00:35:35,968
 it is not physical, but it is a state of your own being which we can call as a spiritual state.

208
00:35:35,977 --> 00:35:59,338
In the spiritual state, nothing can disturb you, nothing can overpower you, nothing can dominate you,

209
00:35:59,347 --> 00:36:10,798
because that state if you have, that means you are part and parcel of reality,

210
00:36:10,807 --> 00:36:20,778
then you are an honoured member of the God¡äs kingdom.

211
00:36:20,787 --> 00:36:40,598
Then you are the most revered personality. Then you are like a deity, then you are like a gana.

212
00:36:40,607 --> 00:37:03,008
In that state, when you are, it¡äs a state, again I say it, beyond the human state, you are extremely powerful.

213
00:37:03,017 --> 00:37:10,248
There is a story about Nisamuddhin, a great Sufi in India.

214
00:37:10,257 --> 00:37:21,378
There was a horrible king, I think Godshah, he called himself. And he (Nisamuddhin) would not go and bow to him

215
00:37:21,387 --> 00:37:28,128
and he was very angry and said, ¡°I can only bow to God¡± and to nobody else.

216
00:37:28,137 --> 00:37:36,088
This Shah said, ¡°if you don¡ät come and bow to me tomorrow, I will cut your throat¡±.

217
00:37:36,097 --> 00:37:41,708
And that night the throat of this king was cut.

218
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:47,958
It is a story, but it is a real story.

219
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:59,298
Somebody came and cut his throat, it was not Nisamuddhin Sahab, he would not do that.

220
00:37:59,307 --> 00:38:10,828
So that state, if you reach, what we call, is a state of Shraddha,

221
00:38:10,837 --> 00:38:26,948
a state of Shraddha which is enlightened, enlightened faith.

222
00:38:26,957 --> 00:38:50,318
It is a new type of mechanism. That is, you become part and parcel of the whole; that means the moon, the stars - you see.

223
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:57,388
I tell you, I never told the sun that it should be there for the Pujas - last time, this time

224
00:38:57,397 --> 00:39:04,918
- I never tell him, there¡äs no need to tell, it is all done.

225
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:15,168
I don¡ät tell all these vibrations to make a cross or to show all these miraculous photographs,

226
00:39:15,177 --> 00:39:21,788
I don¡ät tell them, ther¡äs no need to tell.

227
00:39:21,797 --> 00:39:29,058
They just do it by themselves, I am sometimes surprised how the ingenious methods they have of their own,

228
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:33,488
how they manage things, I am myself surprised.

229
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:43,218
I didn¡ät tell them that these two persons who were selected for this award that they should be so condemned by every newspaper.

230
00:39:43,227 --> 00:39:53,058
It all works automatically, it just works.

231
00:39:53,067 --> 00:40:02,668
Only thing, if I have anything, is just complete, complete faith that I am at that state

232
00:40:02,677 --> 00:40:07,918
and that¡äs why there is complete patience - ahuri.

233
00:40:07,927 --> 00:40:20,628
Complete patience. And that is what we have to learn.

234
00:40:20,637 --> 00:40:27,328
It will all happen in any case, because you are all at that state.

235
00:40:27,337 --> 00:40:34,978
Only meditation is important, very important. For me not, but for you all.

236
00:40:34,987 --> 00:40:50,198
If you all can meditate now, just for 10 minutes also every day, it will help you a lot.

237
00:40:50,207 --> 00:41:02,978
Now why do we have all these statues? - the Mother, Hanumana, and Ganesha, Christ.

238
00:41:02,987 --> 00:41:12,908
Because to begin with, human beings cannot understand anything which does not have a form.

239
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:18,808
They cannot go deeper unless and until there is a form.

240
00:41:18,817 --> 00:41:27,788
But they went to another limit of using any stone, anything as God and all.

241
00:41:27,797 --> 00:41:32,938
But now you have discretion, you know what is to be worshipped,

242
00:41:32,947 --> 00:41:42,238
what is to be treated as a higher personality, that you know.

243
00:41:42,247 --> 00:41:47,248
But before that, they would worship all kinds of people -

244
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:52,538
like now people worship the Pope, you know that, very well.

245
00:41:52,547 --> 00:42:01,178
But now what to do, they are not only blind, they are not only unaware,

246
00:42:01,187 --> 00:42:04,818
but they are also not conscious of it.

247
00:42:04,827 --> 00:42:10,118
They are all at such a level that you cannot tell them.

248
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:18,608
So you are a new type of people, I should say, who have tried to fight it out, to struggle it out,

249
00:42:18,617 --> 00:42:24,878
to know about the absolute truth.

250
00:42:24,887 --> 00:42:34,558
Unless and until you know the absolute truth, you are nowhere, you have no discretion,

251
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:40,278
you have no understanding, you have no wisdom.

252
00:42:40,287 --> 00:42:43,368
But once you know the absolute truth,

253
00:42:43,377 --> 00:42:53,228
then you should not by any chance be half way this and half way that.

254
00:42:53,237 --> 00:43:00,608
That¡äs a very dangerous state of affairs.

255
00:43:00,617 --> 00:43:10,648
Say a seed is sprouted, it is neither a seed nor a tree.

256
00:43:10,657 --> 00:43:14,998
If it doesn¡ät grow, it is useless.

257
00:43:15,007 --> 00:43:25,348
That happens to your awareness, I¡äm again talking of your consciousness, awareness

258
00:43:25,357 --> 00:43:31,758
- and then you are neither here nor there.

259
00:43:31,767 --> 00:43:43,098
There are many people who come to Sahaja Yoga, perhaps maybe to find some peace.

260
00:43:43,107 --> 00:43:51,418
But I get letters, my father is sick, my mother is sick, my sister is sick and then otherwise,

261
00:43:51,427 --> 00:44:00,778
my husband is fighting with me, I¡äm seeking a divorce or thirdly I¡äve lost all my money, I must have some money.

262
00:44:00,787 --> 00:44:12,728
Fourthly, I am a great artist, but my art is not selling. All these stupid problems they bring.

263
00:44:12,737 --> 00:44:19,368
My children are no good, they are troublesome, then my wife is fighting with me,

264
00:44:19,377 --> 00:44:22,918
my mother is fighting with me, brother is fighting with me.

265
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:31,358
Now I said, what sort of Sahaja Yogis these are?

266
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:50,768
The state of being one with the reality, means that the whole of reality is at your feet, the whole of it works for you.

267
00:44:50,777 --> 00:45:08,568
Now once you even get a glimpse of that state, I tell you, you become so much peaceful within yourself.

268
00:45:08,577 --> 00:45:16,168
If you say I am the king, I am the king. If you say I am the beggar, I am the beggar.

269
00:45:16,177 --> 00:45:31,968
What difference does it make to that state, which is like the purest of pure gold, which cannot be tarnished.

270
00:45:31,977 --> 00:45:42,078
Such a state of mind we have to develop, it¡äs more a challenge to us.

271
00:45:42,087 --> 00:45:52,588
We are Sahaja Yogis - alright, we have got realization - alright, we can sing very well - alright,

272
00:45:52,597 --> 00:46:01,538
we have achieved good positions - alright, we are nicely married - alright,

273
00:46:01,547 --> 00:46:07,838
we have got nice children, we have got everything, we have got jobs, this, that - now.

274
00:46:07,847 --> 00:46:21,838
Suddenly one negative force comes in to trouble you - so what? So what?

275
00:46:21,847 --> 00:46:27,968
Otherwise how will you know what you are?

276
00:46:27,977 --> 00:46:34,828
If there is no darkness, how will you know you are the light?

277
00:46:34,837 --> 00:46:45,638
It¡äs a challenge to your own state, at what state you are.

278
00:46:45,647 --> 00:46:56,368
The word state is not so explanatory, in Sanskrit it is Swarupa. Swarupa.

279
00:46:56,377 --> 00:47:05,138
Swa is yourself and rupa is form or state.

280
00:47:05,147 --> 00:47:20,988
That state is possible for all of you by saying - ¡°not this, not this, not this, not this¡±.

281
00:47:20,997 --> 00:47:31,778
As it is, your mind has reached that state that there is no mind, you can do that.

282
00:47:31,787 --> 00:47:45,448
But you have to develop a kind of a personality that realizes what you are.

283
00:47:45,457 --> 00:47:56,828
But in that realization, you are just aware of it, not conscious of it.

284
00:47:56,837 --> 00:48:00,728
I¡äm for example, like that.

285
00:48:00,737 --> 00:48:10,948
I¡äm aware I am Adi Shakti, I am aware I know, but when you say ¡° Shri Mataji¡±, I also say ¡°Jai Shri Mataji¡±

286
00:48:10,957 --> 00:48:24,588
- I forget it that I am the one you are talking about. This is actually, should be the state,

287
00:48:24,597 --> 00:48:30,108
that you are aware, yes, you are aware in the sense, I don¡ät know how to say,

288
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:38,628
but I¡äm aware I am that. If you ask me ¡°Mother, are you Adi Shakti?¡± I say, ¡°Yes, I am ¡°.

289
00:48:38,637 --> 00:48:42,028
Because I know that, that I am.

290
00:48:42,037 --> 00:48:54,238
But when you say ¡°Jai Shri Mataji¡±, I forget that I am Adi Shakti and I also say ¡°Jai Shri Mataji¡± with you.

291
00:48:54,247 --> 00:49:02,908
I forget, and I have to tell, ¡°No, no, you can¡ät say it¡±. It is very interesting.

292
00:49:02,917 --> 00:49:12,828
Now, you make me sit here like a queen and give me presents, this thing, that thing - alright.

293
00:49:12,837 --> 00:49:28,518
That¡äs your idea. But to me, you see, I am complete in myself - I think so.

294
00:49:28,527 --> 00:49:40,148
(Hindi)  I¡äve got lost into myself.

295
00:49:40,157 --> 00:49:48,818
Alright you do this, alright, if you do that, even if you don¡ät do it, it is alright.

296
00:49:48,827 --> 00:49:55,188
To me, it makes no difference, it may make a difference to you, but to me it does not.

297
00:49:55,197 --> 00:50:00,578
Like, I¡äve been saying, now don¡ät give me any presents, don¡ät give me any presents, all these days.

298
00:50:00,587 --> 00:50:04,868
So, the only argument is that the whole year we give you once,

299
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:08,908
so why should you Mother object, because you give us joy.

300
00:50:08,917 --> 00:50:19,348
Alright if you think it gives you joy, you can do it, but to me it doesn¡ät matter.

301
00:50:19,357 --> 00:50:25,488
Because, I don¡ät think I am there.

302
00:50:25,497 --> 00:50:36,718
I¡äm just seeing you sitting here, alright, they are all realized souls, alright.

303
00:50:36,727 --> 00:50:44,318
But I am one of you. I don¡ät think I am very special.

304
00:50:44,327 --> 00:50:49,238
But if you ask me, then I will say, alright I am Adi Shakti.

305
00:50:49,247 --> 00:50:56,078
But I don¡ät think Adi Shakti is very special also.

306
00:50:56,087 --> 00:51:01,428
Because I have no mind, but otherwise I don¡ät think I am somebody special.

307
00:51:01,437 --> 00:51:12,538
Because somebody is somebody, so what. Now supposing, sun is sun, so what, he is the sun.

308
00:51:12,547 --> 00:51:18,018
If somebody is Adi Shakti, so they are Adi Shakti, so what.

309
00:51:18,027 --> 00:51:24,568
But for you it is creditable, because you were not born realized.

310
00:51:24,577 --> 00:51:34,618
You got your realization, so you are special, you are great, you have achieved something.

311
00:51:34,627 --> 00:51:42,588
I have achieved nothing, I have been like this and I will be like this.

312
00:51:42,597 --> 00:51:49,148
Whether I fight the devils, or I sit before you, makes no difference, I will be like this.

313
00:51:49,157 --> 00:51:55,078
But for me, you are great because you have achieved this.

314
00:51:55,087 --> 00:52:05,748
Today to see you on this Navaratri day, so many people sitting to worship me.

315
00:52:05,757 --> 00:52:16,948
So many people are here, so many Sahaja Yogis, its so remarkable, it is not my achievement, I tell you.

316
00:52:16,957 --> 00:52:27,038
It¡äs your seeking. Because I have been on this earth many a times before - that you know.

317
00:52:27,047 --> 00:52:38,728
But we never had like this, so many came and got crucified, died, this, that - but I never had people of this calibre.

318
00:52:38,737 --> 00:52:55,628
So again we come to the same point, that we should be aware of ourselves - complete shraddha in yourself.

319
00:52:55,637 --> 00:53:09,038
If you have some shraddha in yourself, you will have shraddha for me also. Because we are not different.

320
00:53:09,047 --> 00:53:17,128
If you believe this is water, then everywhere there is water then I  believe that that is water, isn¡ät it.

321
00:53:17,137 --> 00:53:26,458
Because I know this is water, so wherever in the world there is water, I know it is water.

322
00:53:26,467 --> 00:53:36,738
So if you know you are a Sahaja Yogi, anywhere there is a Sahaja Yogi you will know there is a Sahaja Yogi, that¡äs a Sahaja Yogi.

323
00:53:36,747 --> 00:53:47,448
But as far as you are concerned you forget how great you are and how far you have come.

324
00:53:47,457 --> 00:54:01,388
I am very proud of you, you don¡ät know, but because I am a humble person, I don¡ät know how to show off.

325
00:54:01,397 --> 00:54:17,718
So I have such nice children, so many of them, so lovable, those bhaktas for whom she killed so many demons and all that.

326
00:54:17,727 --> 00:54:26,908
They are not like you, you are much better, much higher, of a much greater quality.

327
00:54:26,917 --> 00:54:42,688
But you must know that you are and don¡ät behave like those people who were of a very rudimentary nature,

328
00:54:42,697 --> 00:54:53,268
you have grown up, you have prospered and now the fruits we can see.

329
00:54:53,277 --> 00:55:02,918
I don¡ät know what to do for you really, but have faith in yourself,

330
00:55:02,927 --> 00:55:07,128
then you will see how much faith you will have in reality.

331
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:17,188
That there is reality with you at every step, every moment.

332
00:55:17,197 --> 00:55:30,378
No fear, no sense of achievement, nothing. Done now, finished.

333
00:55:30,387 --> 00:55:35,988
When there were 5 Sahaja Yogis, I was happy, when there are so many, I am happy.

334
00:55:35,997 --> 00:55:51,148
But when I see so many, I feel there are so many powerful personalities who are one with reality.

335
00:55:51,157 --> 00:55:59,128
This collective oneness, was never so.

336
00:55:59,137 --> 00:56:15,388
And so, I will say that on this day, what we have to do is to kill the devils within ourselves, that¡äs all.

337
00:56:15,397 --> 00:56:25,168
If you want to really worship me, that¡äs what you have to think, what are the devils within you, that¡äs all.

338
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:33,908
So you don¡ät have to worry otherwise for outside devils, they cannot do anything to you.

339
00:56:33,917 --> 00:56:38,917
MAY GOD BLESS YOU!!!
