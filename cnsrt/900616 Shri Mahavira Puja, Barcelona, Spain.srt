00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:21,851
Shri Mahavira Puja

2
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:44,320
Spain 16th June 1990

3
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:31,931
Today we are going to do puja of Mahavira and we never had this puja before.

4
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:46,371
The reason for this was that Mahavira's life was an ascetic's life,

5
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,601
just like Buddha.

6
00:05:51,610 --> 00:06:09,221
Even more than Buddha it would be because at the time when these two were born,

7
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:21,491
the Brahminism of the Hinduism had taken a very funny form.

8
00:06:21,500 --> 00:07:18,501
People had become extremely ritualistic and they were worshipping all kinds of stones and all kinds of things instead of worshipping only the swayambu.

9
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:35,071
The ascetic life of Mahavira was of a very, very extreme nature.

10
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:49,681
He was the one who was born in a clan of warriors, Kshatriyas,

11
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:56,421
and then He was also married.

12
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,651
Also He had a daughter

13
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:21,371
and then He decided because He knew He had to do the work of the Divine, He decided to take a sanyassa.

14
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:47,191
So He took the permission of His brother because His parents were dead.He was a king, so He gave up all His material wealth, everything and He became a complete sanyassi

15
00:08:47,200 --> 00:09:11,291
and He left His family, left His house, everything behind and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms.

16
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:28,581
And the people who joined Him were very few and He asked them that you have to also become ascetics, munis.

17
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:36,041
He was a reincarnation of St.Michael

18
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,671
and He resides on the left side

19
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,521
on the Ida Nadi.

20
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:58,321
And He looks after the whole of it, right from Mooladhara onwards up to the Sahastrara.

21
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:06,881
So St.Michael was born as Mahavira,

22
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:13,871
meaning the greatest warrior.

23
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:34,071
But when He was born the whole place got lot of prosperity, that's why He was called as wargaman to begin with.

24
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:53,051
But His asceticism was there because of the Brahminism that was so prevalent in those days and people were absolutely drowned into it.

25
00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:09,821
After Shri Krishna, these two persons, Buddha and Mahavira, both of them incarnated in India.

26
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:27,891
As you know, their history is very far out because they were the children of Rama and they were two twins called as Luv and Kush.

27
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:45,961
So Rama led a life of a very great king, benevolent king, and of lots of limitations, mariada purushotama.

28
00:11:45,970 --> 00:12:06,631
Because of that, people became extremely serious and also very closed because of Rama's following.

29
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:25,031
Of course after every incarnation, as they do not get their realization, they get deviated and start going to the extremes of everything.

30
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:52,701
So they went to the extremes and became very, very much sort of quiet people, wouldn't talk to anyone would be very formal sort of people because that was the life Rama had to lead, lead.

31
00:12:52,710 --> 00:13:10,431
And because Rama left His wife many people at that time felt that wife is not to be paid too much attention to.

32
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:26,811
So Shri Krishna came. Actually, Rama took birth as Shri Krishna to overcome these conditionings.

33
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:34,471
And He said, "All this is leela. This is all a play."

34
00:13:34,480 --> 00:14:00,191
And that it is a play and you should have pure heart and you can play about. There is, as long as you have pure character nothing can go wrong if you mix up with people freely.

35
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:14,731
So after Shri Krishna, people started becoming very licentious and permissive

36
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:27,121
and they created poems and things of Krishna's love stories which was all false

37
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:39,781
because He lived with Raddha at the age of five or six years and with the, in the Gokul

38
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:54,551
So all these false stories about Him were used for the licentiousness of the people.

39
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:12,551
So now, the situation was such that the whole place was getting completely drowned into immorality.

40
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:32,711
The priests, the Brahmins themselves, had become extremely immoral and were indulging into all kinds of corrupt practices,

41
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:50,031
not only that but they took to tantric, tantric manifestations of using spirits and things like that

42
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:56,971
and became very self-indulgent.

43
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:09,511
At that time Buddha, Lord Buddha and Mahavira were born

44
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:23,201
to de-condition people from this kind of an extreme behavior

45
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:35,771
because whatever the incarnations tried people always went to the extremes.

46
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:52,521
So they found out that people were very much indulgent in killing animals and eating flesh all the time

47
00:16:52,530 --> 00:17:03,351
and if you eat too much of flesh and all that you become right-sided personality

48
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:11,401
and so then you become very aggressive

49
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:17,001
and start killing others.

50
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:39,231
Moreover, the people who were very much attached to their family or to their children and all that would not do the work of the Divine

51
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:47,001
and it was a very intensive work which He had to do.

52
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:57,041
So He made very strict rules as Moses did.

53
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:10,401
He said that nobody should kill any animal and eat it, first of all.

54
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:33,081
Those who are becoming the munis or the big shoes should not even go on any bullock cart; should walk bare feet; should not even wear shoes.

55
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:51,151
They should shave their head completely; should have only three changes, three dresses with them of a big tunic-like thing.

56
00:18:51,160 --> 00:19:02,051
Whether it is sun or rain, they should not use any umbrellas.

57
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:10,571
They should eat before six o'clock; before the sun sets.

58
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,901
They should sleep only for five hours

59
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:29,951
and all the time meditate and ascend and then try to do the work of the Divine.

60
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:38,031
Then only they can do the work of the Divine.

61
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:53,791
After they get their Realization that He called as Kevalagyan, only the knowledge, only knowledge - means pure knowledge -

62
00:19:53,800 --> 00:20:04,361
they will develop Samvaddharshan - means integrated personality

63
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:11,321
and all the collective consciousness.He talked of all, all these things

64
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:24,261
but as He belonged to the left side, He has described hell very clearly.

65
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:33,571
Fundamentally, basically, there are fourteen hells according to Him

66
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:43,791
and is horrible to read all that what He has described about hell.

67
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:56,141
Because He wanted to tell people that if you do all these wrong things you will go to hell

68
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:09,411
and He talked about, not about form, form God, but formless God,

69
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:16,731
because He didn't want people to again start ritualism

70
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:30,641
but get to right, right to the position where they could get their Self-realization to cleanse themselves.

71
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:50,161
So you can imagine how difficult in those days at Mahavira, was even to be one of the candidates for Self-realization.

72
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:55,581
It's frightening for you.

73
00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:05,191
That's why I never had this puja.

74
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:22,661
Because to do all these things, first of all, and to become absolutely pure, then only He would give Realization.

75
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:40,571
I wonder how many got Realization but the way He made rules for people was so strict.

76
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:54,721
Nobody would have followed Him. But He told them about the hell in which they will go if they don't follow.

77
00:22:54,730 --> 00:23:15,921
So they were so frightened that they joined Him and started following Jainism.'Jain' means 'the one who has known, who is enlightened, gnayan'.

78
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:25,501
Is the, the same word is gnayan means 'to know'.'Ja' - it means 'to know'.

79
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:35,951
Just like the Jews is the same word is the 'Jew' means also 'the one who knows.'

80
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,091
Moses also did the same.

81
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:57,831
He didn't say that you should not eat meat but He said that if anybody is found with another woman he should be killed.

82
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:27,081
The Muslims that they follow Sharia is made by Moses for the Jews because they had become so self-indulgent The Sharia that is followed by Muslims is made by Moses for the Jews

83
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:42,741
because when He brought those Ten Commandments, He found the Jews were indulging into all kinds of nonsensical things.

84
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:54,201
But Jews very nicely put it on the shelf and the Muslims took to it.

85
00:24:54,210 --> 00:25:05,921
So now this Mahavira style went to the extreme as usual,

86
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:14,741
even Lord Buddha's same thing.

87
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:40,801
Mahavira was the one who said that you should not kill any animal, so now in India we have people who are absolutely abstaining from even killing bugs and killing even mosquitoes.

88
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:53,661
How far human beings can go to stupidity can be seen from this.

89
00:25:53,670 --> 00:26:12,371
Nowadays there's a custom, very common in India, that they take, get hold of a Brahmin put him in a hut and put all the bugs inside

90
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:30,661
and when these bugs have got completely, have got completely, fed up with the drinking of the blood of this Brahmin they just drop out.

91
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:44,551
Then this Brahmin is paid a big amount by the Jains who have lots of money.

92
00:26:44,560 --> 00:27:08,011
They are vegetarians to such an extent that they don't want to go to the bathroom, but they'll go on some sort of a open space that no animal should die.

93
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:13,691
Such ridiculous things they do

94
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:28,461
and in the, in all doing all this abstinence and all that they are extremely money oriented.

95
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:43,951
Jains are just like Jews in India.Jains and Jews are the same in their money orientation.

96
00:27:43,960 --> 00:28:06,491
So the Jains won't kill even a bug or a mosquito but they don't mind harassing a man up to his death for their two rupees.

97
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:18,121
So this extreme temperament is seen in every religion

98
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:29,501
and that comes because human beings start moving like a pendulum from one end to another.

99
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:42,451
An incarnation comes and tries to bring them in the center but again they start moving on the other side.

100
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:51,581
They cannot remain in the center.This is the problem of the human beings

101
00:28:51,590 --> 00:29:00,731
and this is why all religions look so funny.

102
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:18,771
When you see the way the Jains are, I mean, you are surprised and can't believe how stupid they are; educated people, doctors,

103
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:27,551
but they never know that, they never understand that they are stupid.

104
00:29:27,560 --> 00:30:04,511
So this is the story of Mahavira where He has tried to bring in a kind.

105
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:18,181
So when I started Sahaja Yoga, if I'd started like Mahavira how many would have joined Me?

106
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:35,081
Even when we have raised the Kundalini you have got your Realization there is not much of detachment.

107
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:53,241
Sanyassi meant that he had nothing to do with his wife, nothing to do with his children, nothing to do with his family or house or anything or possessions, no possessions.

108
00:30:53,250 --> 00:31:53,501
But, and they were given such a little to eat without any, just boiled food, just boiled and such strict order.

109
00:31:53,510 --> 00:32:18,531
But in Sahaja Yoga I have first of all raised your Kundalini without telling you any ritual, any what you can call strictness or anything about it.Just whatever you are, all right, get your Realization.

110
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:44,071
And I thought that by raising the Kundalini, by Self-realization, I need not tell them about hell.Only by that, they will become quite detached and wise.

111
00:32:44,080 --> 00:33:02,851
But even now what you find is that there are people who get married in Sahaja Yoga and just get lost.

112
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:16,611
Either the wife dominates or the husband dominates or both of them get completely lost.

113
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:30,001
Normally in the western countries as soon as they get married first second day they start quarrelling

114
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:37,461
and within one week they start talking about divorce.

115
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:50,711
But in Sahaja Yoga when they get married they just get attached to each other like glue, you see.

116
00:33:50,720 --> 00:34:04,151
Then there is no other interest left all the time thinking of wife, wife, wife or husband, husband, husband,

117
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:18,701
someone to go for honeymoon, someone to do it in a very big way with a reception and things.

118
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:40,811
The importance is given so much, that it is unbelievable that whatever things we have left to come to Sahaja Yoga have become multi-fold

119
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:52,901
and this marriage system that we have started in India is becoming a headache to Me now.

120
00:34:52,910 --> 00:35:08,511
Either they fight as usual and divorce or they get glued together.There's nothing in-between.

121
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:16,921
They don't understand that they have married for Sahaja Yoga

122
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:29,741
and they have to use marriage for Sahaja Yog only.

123
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:57,161
But this attitude of Sahaja yogis is very surprising, because I always felt after Self- realization they will be automatically sanyassis from within.

124
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:05,851
They will themselves be like Mahavira's disciples.

125
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:25,741
But what I find is that still they are always falling back into the same ocean from which they have come on to the boat.

126
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:36,561
For example, now somebody was fond of seeing films or, say, football, of all the things football.

127
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:46,761
So they are still busy with football.Is become a craze with football,

128
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:57,251
or a picnic or a holiday or a sea resort.

129
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:06,261
After Realization how can you enjoy these things so much?

130
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:17,191
That means you have not touched that depth within you yet.

131
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:34,501
Your depth of joy you have not yet touched.Still you have to touch it.Once you have touched that you really don't care for anything.Just don't bother for anything.

132
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:48,111
You are so self-contented you just enjoy your Self.

133
00:37:48,120 --> 00:38:17,901
But I do not know if I should tell you about hell and frighten you, or I should put restrictions on you, but this is the one, Mahavira's puja, I have been avoiding.so far.

134
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:25,871
Even the ladies, had to take out all their hair

135
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:37,091
and wear only white one sari and one blouse, that's all.

136
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:41,461
No shoes,

137
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:55,751
and also had to walk. Never get into a bullock cart, leave alone cars.

138
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:10,911
They had to get up at four o'clock, have their food 'til six only and then sleep off.

139
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:22,081
There is forty days (peruation?) when you have to only live on water, only water.

140
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:29,941
Now in Sahaja Yoga it's the other way round, it's all enjoyment.

141
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:39,961
You enjoy everything. You enjoy each other's company. You enjoy music. There's all enjoyment for you.

142
00:39:39,970 --> 00:40:00,911
But without touching your inner enjoyment you cannot, you cannot ascend. You must touch your inner enjoyment and then enjoy everything else.

143
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:20,101
And any hard word said, even one word said hard they had to repent and go on fast for days together for saying one harsh word.

144
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:37,501
But here people go, suddenly I find they are walking nicely and suddenly they get onto the horse of a ego and start jumping on others.

145
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:55,261
The whole, see is so jocular I tell you.I just watch suddenly what was, he was a nice fellow walking just now.Suddenly what has happened to him? Suddenly he started behaving like this.

146
00:40:55,270 --> 00:41:08,391
I never wanted to frighten you about the hell but there is hell I must say.

147
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:24,781
And so one has to go deeper into your own enjoyment so that there is complete contentment.

148
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:47,961
So the things that are said about Mahavira are taken to the extreme that one day He was meditating and He had only one piece of cloth on Him wrapped with a dhoti and He had covered Himself up with one piece of cloth.

149
00:41:47,970 --> 00:42:10,191
So when He was coming out of His meditation His cloth got entangled with some bush.So He had to take off half of it.

150
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:23,721
Then Krishna came to tease Him as an, as a what do you call, a beggar.

151
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:40,171
And He said, "You are a king and You can always get something cloth but I am shivering, so why don't You give Me this piece of cloth that You have."

152
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:59,851
So He gave Him His cloth and covered Himself with some leaves and went into His palace and changed Himself. Into His house and changed His clothes.

153
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:22,981
So these horrible Jains make His complete nude photographs so huge. Hundred and fifty feet height nude, absolutely nude, into details they work it out, stupid things.

154
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:48,341
And there are followers of His, so called, He never had such followers but they call themselves as degambarras, means they do not have cloth but their cloth is all the directions - degambar."Directions" are their cloth,

155
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:59,171
and they'll walk on the street, walk everywhere in the villages absolutely nude.

156
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:10,761
I mean horrible things people do in the name of Mahavira.

157
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:23,961
Now as you have got Realization I am sure you won't go to that extreme.

158
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:33,221
But still, you must learn to have self-discipline.

159
00:44:33,230 --> 00:45:01,091
If you have no self-discipline you cannot jump into that depth, where there is complete Kevalgnan means absolute knowledge, absolute love and absolute joy.

160
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:24,161
So this self- disciplining is very important. Of course, you need not go to the Mahavira's extent now, because luckily I have given you Realization but still do not go back to things, which you have left.

161
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:44,251
As men also do stupid things, also women do it in Sahaja Yoga which is surprising. People told me that they carry so many make-ups with them to India.

162
00:45:44,260 --> 00:46:11,171
What is the use? I just don't understand.To, to I mean for Indians it is useless and it is absolutely useless for you also.You are saints.There is no need to load yourselves with so many things unnecessarily.

163
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:30,851
So if you again indulge into the same nonsense that you have been doing; going to the hairdresser, looking funny in the hair, all sorts of things if you do, then what's the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga?

164
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:45,345
Or following any fashion and these things.If you have to do the same thing again and again it is better, you don't come to Sahaja Yog.

165
00:46:45,400 --> 00:47:07,157
That's all I can say.I cannot say like Mahavira that you shave your hair, or you wear just a, one white sari.But I can only say that "Try to detach yourself."

166
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:21,401
I was sure with My experiment, that people when they get Realization gradually they'll get detached

167
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:32,741
and you all have to co-operate with Me to see where is your attention.

168
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:36,841
What are we doing the whole day?

169
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:40,951
What have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

170
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,761
How many people we have given Realization?

171
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:55,261
Everything seems to be important but Sahaja Yog.

172
00:47:55,270 --> 00:48:20,551
But Mahavira's day people did not do any jobs, nothing.They had to live in jungles, they had to beg for their food

173
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:28,341
and that's how this Jainism has spread.

174
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:37,161
But what sort of a Jainism it is I have told you already.

175
00:48:37,170 --> 00:49:02,871
So unless and until you touch your depth you'll become like any other religion, because you won't be actually Sahaja Yogis, just nominal.

176
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:22,871
So we have to work in such a manner that we understand ourselves and we understand our attention and we try to ascend.

177
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:41,371
I don't have to tell you.You yourself have to work it out in such a manner that you touch your depth and you become an ascetic within yourself.

178
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:59,521
Then only you will be really doing the Divine work properly with proper understanding.

179
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:13,921
Sahaja Yoga is the integration of all these great prophets and these incarnations.

180
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:33,241
So I have to tell you that, whatever were your conditionings and all that, to get rid of them, you must get out of this ocean of illusion.

181
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:57,071
So this is the only thing I can just now say about Mahavira but lots can be said because of the, He deals with the past.All His past lives and everything are described,

182
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:07,011
but that is not so important.What is important is what is today the present.

183
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:19,231
I hope My lecture goes into your head and settles into your heart

184
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:34,151
and you understand what you have to do about yourself, about your ascent.You have to be genuine people.

185
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:46,681
Then only it is going to show results in the whole world.

186
00:51:46,690 --> 00:52:05,361
I hope you will pass this state to all the people so they should know why I didn't have Mahavira's puja all these years.

187
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:10,370
May God bless you all!
